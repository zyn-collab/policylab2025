# A network of small venues for community arts and culture

## The gap in regular, smaller-scale cultural life

Cultural events and public gatherings in the Greater Malé area are infrequent by the standards of a vibrant capital city, and often limited to large-scale productions. There is a gap in regular, smaller events that could provide ongoing opportunities for interaction and engagement within and across communities. The general mindset toward public events has been oriented around larger productions that need relatively big audience counts to be sustainable — whether to turn a profit on tickets, or to justify the logistics, organizing, and staffing costs for events held by organizations. This means that unless you can sell out a substantial venue, holding an event often does not make sense. The result is a culture where events are occasional rather than constant, where artists and performers need to be already established to justify a booking, and where ordinary residents have few options on any given evening for cultural engagement or social participation outside their homes.

This gap is partly a lack of an established arts policy to support a local scene with the capacity to sustain a constant event calendar, and partly the scarcity of smaller venues that can make smaller events viable. When the only available spaces are large, small productions cannot be sustainable — they need a certain audience size just to cover costs. But when spaces are small — even just 15–20 people — events become viable with much smaller audiences. An emerging artist can build a following of 15 dedicated fans before needing to fill a larger room. A poetry reading or acoustic set can happen with a handful of attendees and still feel like a success. The economics of cultural life shift entirely when venue size matches the scale of the community.

## A distributed network of mini-venues

The proposal is to establish a network of small community spaces spread across the city — mini-venues that can host intimate events, readings, performances, screenings, and gatherings. The goal is to ensure that every resident can access one of these spaces within a short walking distance, no matter where they live or work. These do not need to be purpose-built cultural centres. They can be as small as a single room accommodating 15 people, or as informal as an outdoor area with woven mats for seating.

Implementation would work through partnerships. Cafes, restaurants, and businesses can host or adopt spaces — a restaurant's upper deck becomes an evening venue, a cafe's back room hosts weekly trivia nights, an unused retail space becomes a reading room. Spaces near areas with good lighting and foot traffic work well. Companies can sponsor spaces through small CSR contributions that cover the cost of having someone operate the location during evening hours. The spaces themselves can be designed affordably: sofas, crate seating, bean bags, woven mats for floor seating, fairy lights, plants, art on the walls, a shelf of books. The aesthetic can be warm and inviting without being expensive — what matters is creating environments where people want to spend time and where artists feel they can perform.

## Maintaining a full calendar before a local scene develops

One challenge with any new cultural infrastructure is maintaining momentum before a critical mass of local artists and audiences has developed. If spaces sit empty waiting for bookings, they lose their purpose. The solution is to have easy, repeatable programming that can fill any night that has not been booked by a local artist or performer — screenings of copyright-free classic films on projectors, evenings where people can play board games or read while music plays, readings of poetry by local and international poets, book club discussions, trivia quiz nights. These require minimal logistics and can be run by a single consistent staff member. They serve as the baseline that keeps spaces active and visible, and as word spreads and more artists become aware of the venues, the proportion of nights booked by local creatives will grow and the filler programming can scale back.

An online directory and social media presence would list all events across all venues, with each evening's schedule published in the afternoon so that anyone in the city can find something to attend on any given night. This visibility is crucial: people need to know what is happening and where. As the network matures, the directory becomes a cultural calendar for the entire city — a single place to find out what is on tonight, whether it is a poetry reading in one neighbourhood, a film screening in another, or a live acoustic set somewhere else. The cumulative effect is a city where there is always something happening, where cultural participation becomes routine rather than exceptional, and where emerging artists have a viable path from performing for 15 people to gradually building larger audiences.
