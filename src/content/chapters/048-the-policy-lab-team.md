Zayaan

Zayaan Shaafiu is the Managing Director of Public Policy Lab. He has worked in a variety of policy areas, including economic policy, health, social protection, information policy, housing policy, urbanism and liveability, urbanization and decentralization, education, electoral politics and governance, community enrichment and third spaces, family policy, gender equality and child protection, infrastructure and connectivity, financial inclusion, labour and workplace rights, as well as integration of AI into workflows and advanced workplace AI use, development of data collection and usability frameworks, building monitoring and evaluation systems, public administration and service delivery, and policy implementation.

As a consultant, he has worked with UNDP in the development process of the Strategic Action Plan with a focus on economic sectors; been the Lead Researcher and author for the Cost of Politics in the Maldives project by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy; supported the Ministry of Social and Family Development in the establishment of project-based workplan systems, policy capacity development, and data collection frameworks; and led the Child and Family Well-Being project for UNICEF. Following the publication of the Cost of Politics, the government announced plans for electoral reforms that matched key recommendations proposed in the document [\[link\]](https://www.wfd.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/wfd_2025_cost_of_politics_in_the_maldives.pdf). In work with the Ministry of Social and Family Development, he leads capacity-building initiatives such as compiling disparate research and reporting into indexed portals for evidence-based policymaking, developing modelling tools for policy construction and design, adapting surveys and data collection to better data usability practices, detailed geographical mapping of social service providers to model access to care, development of AI-integrated policy workflows, and more. Some of his other work with the Public Policy Lab includes projects supporting the National Library of Maldives in the development of social council papers, technical documents, action plans, and stakeholder consultations; supporting Hulhumale’ Hospital in developing their statistical reporting and data approaches as a pro bono consultant; and developing policy proposals and advocacy around the development of third spaces in the Maldives.

As Director at the President’s Office in the Special Programs Unit for presidentially prioritized projects, he led the development of data collection mechanisms and the autonomisation and performance enhancement programs for tertiary hospitals and the development of regional hospitals. In this capacity, he was responsible for developing comprehensive data collection from central hospitals, regional hospitals, and 55 islands with daily data over hundreds of key indicators; analysing and generating weekly reports based on collected data for the President and senior officials; working on data-supported performance measures with results such as the 70% reduction of specialist waitlists and the reduction of psychiatry waitlists from 18 months to 2 months; leading projects both through regular site visits and remote project management to train data analysts including at the first public hospital analytics unit in the Maldives at Dr Abdul Samad Memorial Hospital; introduction of teleconsultation services to 55 island health centres; and the introduction of hospital developments such as child development centres, reproductive health centres; and writing and designing the Decentralisation and Autonomisation Report.

The introduction of a teleconsultation system between 55 island health centres and their respective regional hospitals began with psychiatry services which catered to cases such as Alzheimer’s patients and children with severe disabilities who might struggle with regular boat travel to access specialist services, and now cover a range of specialist services, facilitating convenient, private, and efficient access to healthcare in geographically remote islands. The overhaul of data collection systems and development of a monitoring and evaluation framework were carried out with no additional budget, using existing licenses and familiar software to maximize buy-in even among less tech-savvy staff, could be implemented rapidly but showed significant outcomes: for example, data on patient wait times and doctor load informed decisions to change patient flow and reduce doctor burnout; statistics on high incidences of kidney conditions justified the budget requests to hire an additional nephrologist; statistics on mammogram diagnostics highlighted where public health efforts needed to do more outreach; data on specialist visits and waitlists were used to identify where to allocate new doctor hires across the country and where to allocate budgets, which led to overall cost reductions from less need for patients to travel to the capital for procedures [\[link with further details\]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zex6zPCw554tYtB3Pu4eG3fL1UkRmjrZ/view?usp=sharing).

He has also worked within the private sector and tourism industry, including development of investor prospectuses for guesthouses and island locations seeking foreign investment; worked on data-based modelling and forecasting of economic indicators at the Modelling and Forecasting Section of the Maldives Monetary Authority, the central bank and chief financial regulator of the Maldives, where he developed the research base and indicator set for national financial inclusion and worked on the design of unified financial inclusion proposals that evolved into the national e-payments program; and been an analyst on studies of the state of occupational health and safety in the Maldives for the Public Interest Law Centre.

Zayaan has a Master’s degree in Applied Economics and Policy from the University of Windsor, with research on modelling systems to identify high-value high-likelihood donors for nonprofits to improve fundraising targeting. He also holds dual Bachelor’s degrees in Economics and in Teaching with a major in Politics and International Studies from the University of Adelaide, receiving the Excellence Award as first in class for Development Economics and Public Economics.
