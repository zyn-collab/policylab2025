<th><p>Historical Context and Policy Evolution</p>
<p>Malé City is a case study in extreme urbanization. With a population density reaching approximately 69,000 per square kilometre, it is one of the most congested cities on Earth. The trajectory of Malé’s urban development has been defined by an explosion in private vehicle ownership. Vehicle registrations in the region skyrocketed from roughly 5,700 in 1995 to over 115,000 by 2023. Motorcycles now dominate the streetscape, occupying over 80% of road space and turning sidewalks into parking zones.</p>
<p>Urban planning has largely been reactive, struggling to keep pace with the influx of migrants from the atolls. The primary policy response to congestion has been land reclamation—physically expanding the island and creating new ones like Hulhumalé and the recently initiated Ras Malé. While these projects would provide space, they often prioritized housing density and road networks over pedestrian mobility or green space. Malé’s greenery cover is exceptionally low, exacerbating the urban heat island effect and reducing liveability.</p>
<p>Public transport was historically neglected in favor of facilitating private vehicle flow. In 2022, the Raajje Transport Link (RTL) mini-bus service was introduced in Malé, marking a comprehensive attempt to establish a reliable public transit network within the capital. This service represented a major policy pivot, acknowledging that endless accommodation of private vehicles was geometrically impossible. However, the legacy of motorcycle-centric planning means that reclaiming street space for people requires undoing decades of infrastructure designed for machines.</p></th>

The machine that eats space

The capital city of Malé has inadvertently evolved into a machine for converting public space into private vehicle storage. We confirmed this through fieldwork in 2024, measuring twenty-seven streets across the capital to understand exactly how space is being allocated. The numbers are worse than most people realize, though anyone living in Malé probably feels it daily. Parked motorcycles occupy 43.5% of the total drivable road width. When we account for the safety buffers required between vehicles, nearly 40% of the city's street space—land that could be used for walking, trees, or commerce—is effectively dead, serving no purpose other than to store machinery that sits idle for 95%+ of the day. This is land we desperately need for other purposes locked up to store metal.

This allocation produces consequences that ripple through every aspect of urban life. The same survey revealed that 41% of the streets we measured are currently too narrow for an ambulance or a car to pass safely due to parking encroachment. Two-thirds (63%) of our streets cannot accommodate a standard bus. We have engineered a city where emergency response is compromised and mass transit is physically impossible, all to prioritize the storage of private assets on public land. A self-reinforcing loop dictates daily behaviour. Sidewalks are narrow, broken, or blocked by parking—our data shows that on an average street, 38.6% of the total width is unusable for either walking or driving—so walking is difficult and dangerous. Public transport is sparse and unreliable, blocked by the very congestion it seeks to solve, so people feel forced to buy motorcycles for even the shortest trips. Because every adult owns a motorcycle, the city is pressured to surrender more curb space to store them. The result is a city where the basic act of moving from A to B requires navigating a gauntlet of metal and exhaust, and where the right to park has quietly superseded the right to move. This broader logic applies even for the tiny fractions of the day in which motorcycles are being used instead of parked. The road space required for just one person on a motorcycle is equivalent to the space taken up by 18 people seated comfortably in an air-conditioned double-decker bus[^184]. By shifting trips to transit, we do not just move people more efficiently; we create capacity on the roads without widening them or building new infrastructure.

The logic is circular and destructive. The sheer volume of parked vehicles makes any alternative to the private vehicle impossible to implement. If a bus cannot physically fit down the street, it cannot be a reliable option. If an ambulance cannot reach a doorway, the street is failing its most basic function. We are sacrificing mobility, safety, and liveability for storage. The city has been optimized for machines, not human beings.

People are making a rational choice in the current system to own motorcycles. Given the current state of infrastructure, it is often the only practical option. But the aggregate effect of everyone making that individually rational choice is a collective outcome that nobody wants: dangerous streets, pollution, heat, noise, no space for children to play. Breaking out of this requires changing the underlying infrastructure, not just exhorting people to make different choices.

This is not inevitable or irreversible

This state of affairs shouldn’t be treated as a given. Cities from Paris to Barcelona to Amsterdam have reworked their streets to reduce roadside parking and have become greener, more beautiful, and more walkable[^185]<sup>,</sup>[^186]. Paris, in particular, transformed from a car-dominated city into one where cycling and walking are normal and pleasant within about a decade of sustained effort. What they had that we currently lack is political will and a clear vision. This transition is politically difficult and logistically complex. People who currently rely on motorcycles will see changes to parking as a direct threat to their mobility—and in the short term, before alternatives are fully built out, they will be right. Businesses worry about losing customers if parking becomes harder. Politicians fear being blamed for making life harder for ordinary people. These are real concerns that need to be addressed, not dismissed.

| Metric | Current Status (Average Street) | Implication |
|----|----|----|
| Parked Vehicles | Occupy **43.5%** of drivable width. | Nearly half the road is dead storage. |
| Usable Space | **38.6%** of total width is blocked. | Pedestrians and drivers fight for the remaining 60%. |
| Emergency Access | **41%** of streets block ambulances. | Delayed response times are structurally built-in. |
| Transit Access | **63%** of streets block buses. | Mass transit cannot physically reach most neighbourhoods. |

We cannot simply ban our way out of this problem. Owning a motorcycle in Malé is currently a rational response to a hostile environment. It is the only reliable way to control one's time. To change the city, we have to change the rational choice. We propose an integrated mobility program designed to make private vehicle ownership an optional freedom for citizens, rather than a mandatory price of living in the city. This shift relies on four pillars: a transit spine that matches real trip patterns, a dense micromobility network, a parking reform program that reclaims the street, and increasing shade conditions to make the outdoors habitable.

The key insight is that these systems could work together. A bus system without shade at the stops would fail because waiting in the sun is unbearable. An e-bike system without safe streets would fail because people would be too scared to ride. Parking reform without alternatives would fail because people still need to get to work. Success requires a synchronized rollout where each piece reinforces the others.

Public transit as the heart of the city

The foundation of any transition away from motorcycle dominance is reliable public transport that actually works and that respects the user’s time. The Raajje Transport Link (RTL) bus service introduced in 2022 was a major step, but it needs to evolve from a basic service into a comprehensive network people can rely on for daily mobility around the city. This means buses that come frequently enough—every 5-10 minutes during peak hours—that you do not need to check a schedule. This is the standard in well-functioning transit cities: you turn up and go. Routes need to be dense enough that most people in Malé are within a 5-minute walk of a stop, and buses need to run late enough that people working evening shifts can get home safely. Many shift workers, particularly those in hospitality and healthcare, currently face a gap where bus service has ended but their shifts continue. This forces them back onto motorcycles or expensive taxis. Frequency and coverage matter more than fancy vehicles or high-tech features. A basic bus that comes every 8 minutes is infinitely more useful than a luxury bus that comes every 40 minutes. We should prioritize the basics before adding bells and whistles.

To match the variations in travel flows and volumes, a mixed fleet can serve the trips people actually make. This begins with high-frequency trunk routes on main arteries that see buses running every few minutes, creating a "turn up and go" service that requires no schedule checking. This reliability is the single most important factor in shifting commuters from private vehicles; if you know a bus is coming in three minutes, you don't need to take your bike.

Complementing this could be dedicated "work run" routes between high-density residential clusters like Hiya Flats and stopping right at the doorstep for major employment hubs such as the Velaanaage-Police-BML-Majlis-Ministries-PO-Majidiyya office nexus around office start and end hours, or major hospitals around shift times. A key point is that the buses shouldn’t stop a several minute walk away from this site, where office workers have to sweat in the heat from the bus stop to their office – there should be enough volume at peak times to justify having bus stops directly by offices. This directly targets the commuter demographic that currently relies on motorcycles for punctuality. By guaranteeing arrival times for workers, we remove the anxiety of running late for office and the need to guarantee arrival time that drives private vehicle ownership for those who primarily only use them for work.

For school trips specifically, dedicated school bus fleets that pick students up close to home and drop them at school gates would address one of the biggest drivers of motorcycle ownership. Many families cite needing to transport children to school safely as a major reason for motorcycle ownership. If schools run reliable bus services, or if government provides them as a public service, that removes a major constraint forcing families to own vehicles they would rather not have. This can also ease congestion, removing thousands of individual motorcycle trips — parents dropping off and picking up — that clog streets every morning and afternoon.

Any of these two interventions by themselves could reduce peak hour traffic significantly; implementing both could go a long way to easing congestion in the city. The impact of substituting motorcycle trips for public transport is even stronger when looking at the spatial math of this substitution. The road space required to move one person on a motorcycle (approximately 36 square feet including safety buffers) is roughly 9 times the space required for a passenger on a minibus and 18 times the space required for a passenger on a double-decker bus[^187]. By shifting trips to transit, we create capacity on the roads without widening them.

A people-centred transport system also has to be fair. Fares need to be set at levels that ordinary workers and students can afford, with clear concession schemes for low-income households, older people and people with disabilities. Buses, ferries and micro-mobility infrastructure should be physically accessible, with ramps, priority seating and safe boarding points. If we ignore these elements, new systems risk entrenching inequality rather than easing it. We could also address those who cannot simply walk to a bus stop. A "senior mobility service" — an on-demand, door-to-door van service — could allow the elderly and people with disabilities to book rides to clinics, mosques, or markets. This bridges the gap for those who are currently isolated by the lack of accessible transport, turning isolation into autonomy.

E-bikes can be even more convenient than motorcycles

The goal is for public transport to meet the vast majority of travel needs for people, but a purely transit-based city is unfeasible. Public transport would ideally be supported by a dense network of electric bikes. Going from the example of other cities, e-bikes can be left at the point where the rider embarks and authorities would regularly return undocked e-bikes back to docking stations, so traveling for that last mile by e-bike would get you to the doorstep of wherever you’re going for just as easily as with a motorcycle, while also saving you the hassle of having to look for parking since you can put it anywhere and know it will get picked up and returned. As for density of docking stations to look at how far someone would have to go to find an e-bike to use, we can try to ensure that an e-bike is always within an at most 3-minute walk of key locations: schools, clinics, markets, and ferry jetties. If we were to treat a 3-minute walk as a 250 metre radius (around 0.2 sq km), all of Male’ would be covered by around 8 docking stations, and all of Hulhumale Phase 1 – even without considering for population distributions, since emptier spaces would not need to have the same distribution – would be covered by another 8 stations. Later in this brief, in the section on the Urban Heat Island effect, we argue for installing as much direct shading as possible across walkways to make short walks to the docking stations easy and bearable. That said, if we want an even higher density – let’s say a docking station within a 175m radius, to be under 2 minutes at furthest – that’s still only 20 or so docking stations each for Male’ and Hulhumale Phase 1 respectively. Docking stations are not particularly expensive or space-consuming infrastructure, so anywhere within these ranges that guarantee maximum uptake of e-bike use is still reasonable.

This system offers efficiency that private ownership cannot match. Unlike a private motorcycle which sits idle for 23 hours a day, a shared e-bike serves dozens of people. It is a high-utilization asset, rather than a dead storage asset. A pricing model that offers heavy free usage or includes travel in a transit pass encourages regular travel. This aligns the cost structure with the desired behaviour: quick, efficient hops across the city that replace the short motorcycle trips that currently clog our roads. E-bikes being electric makes them a feasible replacement for motorcycles when it comes to most travel, removing the physical strain of pedalling in the heat and making cycling a viable option for office workers in formal attire or older adults who might otherwise avoid it. It flattens the effort curve of active transport, making it a realistic choice for the widest possible demographic, to go alongside the wide expansion in mobility for citizens through expanded public transport.

It is worth acknowledging that share bike systems have failed in some cities when poorly implemented—bikes stolen, vandalism, docking stations in the wrong places. This requires real investment in maintenance, enforcement, and smart station placement based on actual trip patterns, not just where it is convenient to install stations. Learning from failures elsewhere is cheaper than repeating them.

Vehicle buyback programs

The transition away from pavement parking requires dealing with the existing stock of vehicles. A voluntary motorcycle buyback program could offer a mobility dividend—a combination of cash and long-term free transit/e-bike passes—in exchange for surrendering a vehicle. This allows households with multiple idle motorcycles to liquidate them for value, reducing the total fleet size without coercion. Motorcycles that are bought back could be refurbished and exported to developing markets where urbanization patterns and trip distances still favour two-wheelers. The revenue from these exports could help offset the cost of the rebates, creating a fiscally sustainable cycle of decongestion. Whether this actually works depends on demand in export markets and refurbishment costs, which we would need to test through a pilot program before committing large sums.

As the fleet size stabilizes and alternatives come online, we could enforce the reclamation of the curb through phased rollout. Once reliable transit and e-bike alternatives are active in a neighbourhood, street parking in that zone could be phased out in favour of structured, off-street parking facilities. These facilities could be priced to ensure turnover, providing a legitimate home for the remaining vehicles while freeing the curb for its highest uses: shade, commerce, and community space. Changes to parking rules and vehicle fleets should be phased and predictable, since moving too fast might create non-compliance which either requires harsher enforcement that angers people, or sets a tone from the start that these rules aren’t meant to be followed or enforced. That said, even with initial anger, people adapt quickly. People have adapted to policy changes they had initial anger about repeatedly in the past as they begin to see the outcomes, and they will do so again. Some short-lived controversy and negative social media cycles will blow over, while people will see lasting positive impact for years once the policy has been fully implemented and this world has become the new normal. Moving too slowly means streets remain unsafe and clogged and nothing changes.

A sensible approach is to announce a schedule for reducing on-street parking in the most congested areas, backed by new alternatives in the form of structured parking and better public transport. Motorcycle buybacks and export schemes could be piloted on a small scale first, with real-world data on prices and demand, before committing large sums. This is one of those reforms where we need to be willing to experiment, adjust, and scale up.

| Component | Role in the System | Key Metric for Success |
|----|----|----|
| Transit Spine | Handles heavy commuter/school load. | Headways \< 10 mins; "Turn up and go." |
| Shared E-Bikes | Solves the "last mile" in heat. | Station every 300m; \< 2 min walk. |
| Buyback Program | Reduces total vehicle stock. | % of fleet exported/retired per year. |
| Structured Parking | Houses remaining private vehicles. | 85% occupancy; zero sidewalk parking. |

The urban heat trap

The cost of this vehicle dominance is not just spatial; it is thermal. In a tropical climate, the materials we use to build our city matter intensely. Asphalt and concrete are thermal sponges; on a clear day, they absorb solar radiation and re-emit it as heat, often reaching temperatures 13°C higher than the ambient air. On the hottest days, the road surface itself can hit 82°C — hot enough to cause contact burns. Pavements can reach up to 67°C and radiate heat back into the air[^188]. Parked motorcycles exacerbate this effect, functioning as thousands of dispersed radiators. Their dark metal, rubber, and leather components absorb solar energy, with surface temperatures reaching 60–65°C. Overall, impermeable urban surfaces absorb up to 95% of solar energy that falls on them[^189], which is then re-radiated, increasing ambient temperatures[^190]. This heat is then radiated back into the street level, trapping pedestrians in a layer of superheated air. The amount of heat radiated by objects depends on their temperature, so materials that absorb heat and get hot when in direct sunlight are themselves emitting a lot of heat back out[^191]. This phenomenon is compounded by heavy hydrocarbon pollutants from vehicle exhaust. Because these particles are heavier than air, they linger close to the ground, absorbing additional heat and creating a localized oven effect at the exact height where children and people in wheelchairs breathe.

In a high-humidity environment like ours, the body relies on the evaporation of sweat to cool down. When ambient heat and humidity rise together, this mechanism fails. If the ambient air temperature rises above the normal body temperature of 37°C on a humid day, the body has no way to release its metabolic heat. Walking a mere 400 meters in these conditions can raise core body temperature to dangerous levels. This reality effectively acts as a curfew for the vulnerable. The elderly, people with disabilities, and parents with young children are functionally excluded from the public realm during the day, not by law, but by physics. We have built a city that is thermally abusive to its own residents. Paired with the lack of greenery and canopy cover and unshaded surfaces, this has a massive impact on day-to-day quality of life[^192]. A greener city would also have positive second-order effects, from energy savings in a cooler city[^193]<sup>,</sup>[^194] particularly for AC in ground-level and first-floor spaces.

The interaction between our built environment and our climate is currently a hostile one. We have paved over our cooling surfaces and replaced them with heat-retaining ones. We have stripped away shade to make room for parking, exposing the pavement to direct solar radiation which it then radiates back at us. We have filled the air with pollutants that trap that heat. The result is an Urban Heat Island effect that makes Malé significantly hotter than the surrounding ocean or even nearby islands with more vegetation.

| Surface/Object | Peak Temperature (Sunny Day) | Impact |
|----|----|----|
| Asphalt Road | Up to 82°C | Radiates intense heat upwards; burn risk. |
| Motorcycle Seat | 60–65°C | Acts as a localized radiator at waist height. |
| Shaded Pavement | ~30–32°C | Manageable for walking; allows commerce. |
| Human Body | 37°C | Cannot cool down if ambient temp \> 37°C + high humidity. |

Our research on urban greenery shows much room for improvement in canopy cover, especially in Male’. At least 40% or so of canopy coverage is needed on a city block to achieve maximum cooling and mitigate the urban heat island effect[^195]. While parts of Hulhumalé achieve a tree canopy coverage of 30–40% — the threshold required to significantly mitigate the heat island effect — Malé currently languishes between 12.5% and 16.5%[^196]. This lack of shade is a primary driver of the city's thermal hostility. The 2.5-meter strips of land currently occupied by parked bikes are suitable dimensions for tree pits and wider sidewalks. Planting these corridors does more than beautify the street; it acts as a form of preventative healthcare. A continuous canopy can reduce surface temperatures by 10–20°C and air temperatures by 3–5°C. It creates a "cool corridor" that makes walking to a bus stop or a shop viable even at noon. This temperature differential is the difference between a walkable city and one that requires air-conditioned vehicle transport.

Examples from around the world show that powerful urban heat island effects can be reversed. Cities in Japan saw strong UHI effects, with average urban temperatures rising around 4-6x more than the average global temperature rise and surface temperatures in dense areas reaching up to 60°C. Policies in response have focused on urban greening, high-albedo materials, and design that encourages wind flow. Tokyo implemented cool pavements that lowered road temperatures by 10°C. In Hong Kong, shade structures were paired with tree planting to improve thermal comfort. Singapore has also used canopy cover, green roofs, high-albedo surfaces, and urban design techniques. Cool pavements, high-albedo materials, and green infrastructure were among the most cost-effective approaches to reduce ambient temperatures. New York City, California, Phoenix and Austin have promoted or mandated cool roofs, and policy encourages increased shading, cool roofs, and reflective material use[^197]. Direct solar radiation hitting exterior walls and roofs causes a huge amount of heat to move into a building through the walls. The walls and roofs of buildings themselves being shaded, even with shade at an angle, will greatly reduce this heat. In hot weather, direct sunlight carries heat much more powerfully onto surfaces than wind can remove it[^198].

In Hong Kong, trees with large crowns and dense canopies planted in high density areas were most effective, reducing pedestrian-level temperatures by up to 5.1°C. Only 30% of solar infrared is transmitted through leaves to the ground below[^199]. Trees and similar shading can remove a large amount of the short-wave radiation from the sun by reflecting or blocking rays as they travel through to ground level[^200]. In many contexts, getting enough greenery at a high enough level to provide enough shade may not be feasible. Even where trees can’t be planted directly, high levels of even biodegradable or removable man-made shading tools that can shade sidewalks or streets while reflecting some sunlight back into the air or at least re-radiating it higher up away from where people live and walk.

Studies on urban heat islands highlight that green spaces and vegetation reduce surface temperatures through evapotranspiration, providing cooler microclimates and improving quality of life. Cities with small “pocket parks” have successfully lowered temperatures and created new community spaces[^201]. Beyond the thermal benefits, the psychological impact of greenery softens the visual noise of the city, reducing stress and encouraging people to linger[^202]. It transforms the street from a conduit for traffic into a place for people. This has direct economic implications. Currently, shops and cafes are barricaded behind walls of parked steel. Clearing the curb opens the frontage, allowing businesses to spill out into shaded seating areas. Shade that reduces reflectivity and prevents sunlight from reaching dark and impermeable urban surfaces shouldn’t only be trees, even though greenery is the optimal choice.

Repairing the built fabric

Ultimately, this program is about healing the fragmentation of the city. The current built environment often features rickety, unsafe housing on plots too small to support modern development. You cannot retrofit proper plumbing or electrical systems or add structural reinforcements when the plot is barely wider than the building itself. A voluntary land swap program could allow owners of these unworkable plots in Malé to exchange their land for high-quality, equivalent units in new developments. This is a trade of asset-rich, cash-poor stagnation for liquid, high-quality living. These consolidated plots in the capital could then be repurposed not for more density, but for relief. They would become pocket parks, community squares, or civic amenities—the third spaces currently missing. This aligns the incentives of property owners with the public good, creating a mechanism to de-densify the most crowded blocks while providing dignified housing for families. Not everyone will take this deal. Some people are deeply attached to their current location or have family reasons to stay. But even modest uptake creates meaningful improvement.

This kind of land swap program is complex to administer. You need fair valuations, clear legal processes, guarantees about quality of replacement housing. It will take years to implement properly. But the alternative is continuing with a built environment that is increasingly unsafe and unliveable, where families are trapped in substandard housing because they cannot afford to move and cannot improve what they have.

Changes worth the political capital

This is a vision of a city that works for human beings. A parent sends their child to school on a bus without worry, knowing the stop is safe and the bus is reliable. A nurse rides an e-bike home under the shade of trees, feeling a breeze instead of a blast of exhaust. An elderly person crosses the street to a mosque without fear of being struck by a speeding motorcycle. What we want to see is a shift from a city designed for the storage of machines to a city designed for the living of life.

The current trajectory—more motorcycles, more parking, more congestion—is making the city less liveable for everyone, including motorcycle owners. Even people who own motorcycles would benefit from streets that are safer, quieter, and less polluted. The current system serves nobody well. It just happens to be what emerged from decades of incremental decisions with no overall plan. Breaking out of this requires sustained political leadership and a willingness to push through initial opposition to deliver long-term benefits. The first year of removing parking and adding bus lanes will be difficult. There will be angry editorials and social media campaigns. Business owners will complain. Politicians will be tempted to backtrack. But if we hold steady and deliver the promised alternatives, people will adapt and, within a few years, wonder how they ever lived in the old system.

Cities around the world have done this successfully. Paris removed tens of thousands of parking spaces and is now one of the most liveable capitals in Europe. Barcelona created superblocks that prioritize pedestrians and has seen dramatic improvements in air quality and public health. Amsterdam was once dominated by cars and is now the global standard for cycling infrastructure. None of these transformations were easy or universally popular when they started, but they are now seen as tremendous successes that improved quality of life for residents. These successes, once seen by the public, have become beloved and appreciated. The new version of their city becomes one people feel proud of and identify closely with. Even if this requires using up some short-term political capital during early implementation enforcement, holding ground and seeing these changes through will reap benefits.

We can do this too. We have the data, we have examples from other cities, we know what works. What we need is the political will to start and the persistence to finish. The benefits are enormous but diffuse—everyone gets a better city. Some reforms are worth fighting for even when they are difficult.
