Remote Office Hubs by BCC — Hire nationwide, manage from one desk

**The single window**

The **Business Centre Corporation (BCC)** coordinates a network of Council-run Remote Office Hubs across the islands. One platform, one set of standards, one contract style. You don’t negotiate with dozens of councils—BCC does the coordination.

What you get

- **Reliable workspaces** near where people live—desks, meeting rooms, printers, fast internet with backup, daily oversight.

- **Quality control**: every hub follows the same BCC SOP; speed tests and uptime are logged twice a day; hubs are audited and delisted if they fall short.

- **Simple contracting**: one standard licence; clear pricing; weekly attendance CSVs; monthly invoices.

- **Bigger talent pool**: reach candidates in many islands without opening an office in Malé.

- **Lower costs**: seats at a fraction of city leases; no fit-out, no long lock-ins.

- **Reputation**: jobs near home, visible community benefit.

How it works

1.  **Tell BCC your needs**: roles, headcount, start date, preferred islands (if any).

2.  **We broadcast** your requisition to participating hubs and councils; local applicants apply back through BCC.

3.  **You shortlist and hire**; we reserve seats in the right hubs and issue a standard licence.

4.  **You manage** with weekly attendance reports and a BCC contact for any issues.

Service levels

- Uptime target **≥ 99.0%**; daily speed tests logged.
