<th><p>Historical Context and Policy Evolution</p>
<p>Regional airport development in the Maldives began in earnest during the 1980s as part of a broader strategy to mitigate the challenges of geographic fragmentation. The inauguration of Hanimaadhoo Airport in 1990 was a pivotal moment in this effort, intended to connect the northernmost atolls to the economic centre in Malé. For decades, however, aviation policy remained highly centralized. While Hanimaadhoo was officially designated an international airport in 2012, operations were largely domestic due to significant infrastructure constraints, including a runway length insufficient for narrow-body jets and a lack of refuelling capacity. Consequently, the airport functioned primarily as a feeder node for Velana International Airport rather than as an independent gateway.</p>
<p>Transportation policy has historically grappled with the high operational costs of inter-atoll connectivity. Successive governments have subsidized the national carrier to maintain essential transport links to remote regions, accepting this as a necessary public service despite the fiscal burden. The concept of regional hubs has been embedded in national planning documents since the 1990s, identifying the north — specifically Kulhudhuffushi and Hanimaadhoo — as a priority zone for economic development. The strategic intent was to create counter-magnets to the intense congestion of the Greater Malé Region. Despite these plans, economic activity remained concentrated in the capital, partly because regional airports lacked the direct international connectivity required to stimulate independent tourism markets and reduce the cost of travel for tourists.</p>
<p>In 2022, a significant policy pivot occurred with the commencement of the Hanimaadhoo International Airport expansion project, financed through Indian loan assistance. This initiative represents a decisive move to operationalize the long-standing goal of northern decentralization. Unlike previous incremental upgrades, this project aims to extend the runway to 2,460 meters and construct a terminal capable of handling 1.3 million passengers annually. The explicit objective is to facilitate direct flights from South Asia, bypassing the traditional Malé transit hub.</p></th>

The Maldivian economy has historically relied on a single, highly successful formula: high-yield luxury tourism anchored at Velana International Airport (VIA)[^35]. While this model has driven significant development for decades, it creates a structural vulnerability where the nation’s economic health remains tightly coupled to the discretionary spending of a relatively narrow global elite. This reliance leaves the economy exposed to external demand shocks — from pandemics to global economic downturns — and limits the direct benefits of tourism to specific geographic pockets[^36]. Consequently, the state is often forced to intervene with immense subsidies and public sector employment to support populations in regions that the luxury market does not naturally reach[^37].

Maintaining this singular focus risks blinding policymakers to a historic demographic shift occurring immediately on our doorstep: the explosive rise of the Asian middle class[^38]<sup>,</sup>[^39]<sup>,</sup>[^40]. We are currently witnessing an economic transformation in India that mirrors the trajectory which drove the massive expansion of Chinese outbound tourism between 2009 and 2019[^41]<sup>,</sup>[^42]<sup>,</sup>[^43]. With India projected to add over 100 million people to its middle class by 2030, we face a rapidly closing window to align our infrastructure with this massive demographic dividend. These are young, upwardly mobile individuals for whom international travel is transitioning from a once-in-a-lifetime luxury to a periodic norm — provided the price is right.

#### The affordability tipping point and implications

Capturing this market requires understanding a specific economic mechanism: the affordability tipping point. This is the specific price band where a trip shifts from being a major financial decision requiring months of saving to a casual, repeatable option for a long weekend. We can look to European aviation markets for a clear proof of concept[^44]<sup>,</sup>[^45]. Market analysis of routes like London to Barcelona (approx. 1,200 km) or London to Ibiza (approx. 1,400 km) suggests that a price difference of roughly \$60 to \$70 on a return ticket is often the catalyst that alters travel behaviour[^46]. When budget carriers brought fares down from the \$140 range to the \$60–\$80 range, they did not just steal market share from legacy carriers; they created entirely new volume[^47]. They turned these destinations into regular weekend getaways for the British middle class, unlocking high-frequency travel from singles, friend groups, and young couples[^48].

Table 1: The "tipping point" effect in comparison

|     |
|-----|

| Route | Distance | "Legacy" Fare | "Budget" Fare | The Difference | Result |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| London - Barcelona | 1200 km | \$140 | \$80 | \$60 | High-frequency weekend leisure travel |
| London - Ibiza | 1400 km | \$130 | \$60 | \$70 | Mass youth & group tourism market |
| Bangalore - Malé (VIA) | 1100 km | \$220 | -- | -- |  |
| Bangalore - Hanimaadhoo | 840 km | -- | \$90 (Target) | \$130 | Potential for high-frequency regional travel |

Similar economic spillover effects have been documented in regions connected by high-speed rail (HSR) or short-haul aviation corridors[^49]. Research on regional development indicates that when transport accessibility crosses this tipping point, the "peripheral" region effectively becomes part of the market of the wealthy metropolis. Reducing travel time below about 3 hours integrates peripheral regions into metropolitan economies[^50]. Improved accessibility leads to higher employment, increased investment and spillover economic growth[^51]. The consumption power of the city flows into the region as demand for services, food, and leisure. For the Maldives, the goal would be to replicate this dynamic with Southern India, turning the northern atolls into an accessible, high-value neighbour to cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad.

#### Hanimaadhoo’s comparative advantage to VIA is location

Currently, the Maldives’ infrastructure and cost structure effectively lock us out of this high-volume market. Return fares to Malé typically sit in the \$220–\$280 range, a price point that keeps the destination in the "special occasion" category for the regional middle class. However, the northern airport at Hanimaadhoo offers a unique geographic advantage that could allow us to bypass these barriers. Flights from key southern Indian hubs are significantly shorter to the north than to the central region: from 200-300 km shorter, which is a 20-25% or so shorter trip.

Table 2: Flight distance and potential cost savings

| Origin City | Distance to Malé (VIA) | Distance to Hanimaadhoo | Distance Saving (One Way) | Fuel Saving (Est. per rotation)\* |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Bangalore | 1100 km | 840 km | 260 km | 1500–1800 kg |
| Chennai | 1200 km | 1000 km | 200 km | 1200–1400 kg |
| Hyderabad | 1600 km | 1300 km | 300 km | 1800–2000 kg |
| Mumbai | 1700 km | 1400 km | 300 km | 1800–2000 kg |

Note: Fuel savings are indicative estimates for a narrow-body aircraft (e.g. A320/B737) based on typical cruise fuel burn rates, factoring in climb/descent phases remaining constant.

This reduction in distance translates directly to the bottom line of airline economics. For a Low-Cost Carrier (LCC), the two most critical cost drivers are fuel burn and block hours (aircraft utilization). IATA fuel efficiency analysis noting that fuel accounts for around 25-30% of operating costs, making shorter sectors critical for LCC margins[^52]. Saving 30–45 minutes of flight time per leg allows an airline to potentially squeeze in an extra rotation per day with the same aircraft, dramatically lowering the unit cost per seat. This natural, structural cost advantage is something that VIA, located further south, cannot replicate for this specific source market.

LCCs boost the growth of secondary airports and can put smaller airports on the map for bigger markets[^53]. In Europe, LCCs had a major role in launching new routes[^54] and diversifying airline networks, establishing new regional linkages[^55]. LCCs drove 86% of traffic growth at regional European airports[^56]. Although LCCs are not exclusive to only smaller airports and also compete with full-service network carriers (FSNCs) at large airports, Ultra-LCC options often operate in regional and secondary airports. Regionally, pioneering small airports that were early to invite and integrate a higher share of LCCs retained their role in the market. Formerly secondary smaller cities also benefited heavily from the expansion of LCCs to become large enough to themselves be considered primary cities with large primary airports[^57].

#### Economic spillover effects from effortless connectivity

The economic logic here mirrors the transformative impact of High-Speed Rail (HSR) networks in East Asia. When HSR connected second-tier cities to major economic hubs like Shanghai or Tokyo, reducing travel times to under 3 hours, the economic relationship shifted fundamentally. The smaller cities stopped being distant outposts and became integrated parts of the larger economic zone. The "weekend economy" — tourism, dining, and short-stay leisure — boomed because the friction of travel dropped below a psychological threshold. By reducing the flight time from Bangalore or Chennai to Hanimaadhoo to roughly 1.5 hours and the cost to under \$120, we would be creating a similar "virtual HSR" link. We would effectively be positioning the northern Maldives not as a distant international destination, but as a domestic-adjacent leisure hub for Southern India's tech and industrial capitals. This taps into a market of tens of millions of consumers who have disposable income but are time-poor, making convenience and accessibility the primary drivers of their travel choices.

Policy levers for encouraging low-cost international travel to HAQ

However, geography alone is likely insufficient to hit the target return fare band of \$90–\$140. To bridge the final gap, we could utilize specific fiscal levers. Currently, the \$60 departure fee for non-residents acts as a significant floor on ticket prices. For a luxury traveller paying \$1,000 for a ticket, this fee is negligible (6%). For a budget traveller looking for a \$120 fare, it is prohibitive — it effectively consumes 50% of the ticket value. A strategic policy would be to implement a standing waiver of this departure fee for non-residents specifically on these northern routes.

To maintain downward pressure on prices through competition, agreements could be made with multiple low-cost carrier airlines to serve this market. By combining the LCC’s structural efficiency with this fiscal incentive, we could realistically bring fares down to the \$100–\$120 range. LCCs have been growing rapidly in neighbouring regions[^58]. This is the sweet spot identified in the European examples — the price point that triggers the behavioural shift from annual tourism to frequent, spontaneous travel. Airports in Europe where LCCs provided over 50% of available seats were secondary and regional airports that rose as a result of market policies within the EU[^59].

#### Targeting complementary and non-overlapping markets

A concern some might raise with introducing low-cost routes might the risk of cannibalizing the high-yield traffic that sustain the central atolls. However, this strategy creates a robust geographic segmentation. Internal travel within the Maldives remains expensive; a speedboat transfer between atolls or a domestic flight can cost hundreds of dollars. A budget-conscious traveller landing in Hanimaadhoo on a \$90 ticket is unlikely to pay an additional \$300 to transfer to a resort in Malé or Ari Atoll. They are effectively a "captive market" for the northern atolls.

This creates a new distinct tourism product: an accessible glamorous weekend alternative to domestic Indian destinations like Goa, but with the cachet of the Maldives brand[^60]. It appeals to a demographic that is currently priced out of luxury tourism in the Maldives. Rather than competing for the same higher-end tourists that fly into VIA, Hanimaadhoo would compete with regional destinations, expanding the total size of the Maldivian tourism pie.

#### Regional development without relying on state spending

The primary dividend of this strategy is not just arrival numbers, but the type of development it fosters. Currently, the state often functions as the "employer of last resort" in the atolls. To support communities that lack economic drivers, the government is forced to create public sector jobs and subsidize State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to maintain employment levels. This is a fiscally draining model that offers little long-term upward mobility.

By flooding the northern atolls with a new class of middle-income consumer, we would create organic demand for a different tier of services. A consistent influx of thousands of budget-conscious tourists would create sustained demand for mid-tier guesthouses, cafes, water sports centres, and restaurants — businesses that are typically owned and staffed by locals. This demand creates a pull factor for private investment. We would likely see a wave of local entrepreneurship to service these visitors, driving regional development through private sector velocity rather than state planning[^61]. This shifts the economic engine of the north from government dependence to market-driven growth.

In the long-run, this might also end up encouraging Maldivians to start businesses in India and commute back to their families, bringing in further income and remittances, as well as generally bringing in new and affordable products into the Maldives as airfare. These may be relatively marginal impacts but we just mention it here as possible second-order effects through which the Northern regions can also capture even more economic spillovers from growth of customer bases in the Indian market, and get easier access to goods from abroad the way people can close to Male’.

#### Role in fiscal stability and debt reduction

The projected growth in the South Asian tourism and outbound flight market is higher than the rate of growth in government budgets. If a proportionate share of additional South Asian tourists can be captured from the projected increase in outbound travel from the region due to middle-class growth[^62]<sup>,</sup>[^63]<sup>,</sup>[^64], that 500% increase over 5 years for the market segment is around a 38% increase year-on-year. Of course, this is an increase in only a segment, so the numbers aren’t a direct comparison with percent changes in overall government revenue – but this is illustrative of how a rapid revenue increase could be a windfall opportunity to reset the Maldives’ economic trajectory.

While this approach would concede some direct airport fee revenue per flyer for the state, it allows us to engineer the low-cost environment needed to catalyse the route. If a lot more tourists fly into Hanimaadhoo as a result, though, the hit to total revenue directly gained from airport taxes could be significantly lower, or even end up being a positive balance – on top of this, the spending done by tourists in guesthouses and local businesses bring in additional revenue to the state, as does the resulting multiplier effect causing more economic growth. This is even before considering the reduced need for state investment for development into the Northern region which would reduce government expenditure, the reduced internal migration from Northern atolls to the Greater Male’ Area as a result of greater economic opportunities which can allow for reduced government expenditure to sustain the Male’ area population compared to current baseline trends, and the opportunity for other fiscal stability measures that become possible to carry out without a politically damaging hit to people’s quality-of-life as it’s made up for through direct economic growth in the North.

If governments can resist the urge to just spend additional revenue or cost savings to boost even more government spending at annual deficits, a share of additional net revenue could go toward government surpluses and debt repayment. Running government surpluses or even significantly smaller deficits showing a serious approach toward fiscal improvements could then improve credit ratings, lower interest rates on future borrowing, and increase the likelihood of even further foreign investment and concessional finance, would even by itself help improve the precarious fiscal and budget situation for the Maldives[^65]. With a rapidly growing economy as the denominator, the debt-to-GDP ratio could improve as long as debts grow at a smaller rate. With growth currently projected around 5%, even a potential bump up to 7% growth is the difference between an economy that is 28% larger within 5 years versus one that is 40% larger. Even a small bump up to 6% growth is the difference between an economy which is 28% larger and one that is 34% larger. Even if total debt still grows at 3% per year, the debt-to-GDP ratio with 7% economic growth after 5 years could go from 116% to 95%.

At even an average salary of MVR 10,000 per month, the annual savings from 130 government employees finding equivalent employment through the private sector or tourism-driven entrepreneurship is a direct cost reduction of MVR 15.6 million, or around USD 1 million. This is without considering the additional tax revenue from these employees or businesses. For 1300 government employees, this is around USD 10 million. This is still a very small share of the current annual deficit of around USD 570 million, but it is a start. If tourism can boom at the same expected rate as corresponding projected middle-class growth and outbound tourism growth in South Asia, the number of employees that can switch from net-negative-revenue public sector jobs to net-positive-revenue private sector jobs could reach higher numbers, especially paired with an active job-matching strategy and incentives. As numbers reach up to 10,000 or so private sector jobs replacing public-sector ones, this reaches around USD 78 million, not counting corresponding increases in tax revenue from businesses booming enough to hire these employees and the tourism supporting it. This approaches around a 14% reduction in the deficit in a vacuum.

These are rough numbers based on possible scenarios, not forecasts. The debt dynamics described here depend on traffic volumes, load factors, fare levels and airline behaviour that we cannot control. The big picture argument is that a well-used Hanimaadhoo hub could materially improve the fiscal picture. However, any policy with significant projected economic impact has the risk of unforeseen impacts or cost overrun during implementation. The initial policy commitment can be to treat Hanimaadhoo as a high-potential but experimental regional growth strategy, managed with clear safeguards and regular review, to observe its potential as a guaranteed second engine of growth.

#### Role in boosting foreign reserves and supporting exchange rates

In a study of whether there would be an increase in tourism demand within surrounding regions and inbound arrivals when LCCs are based in areas with large diasporas and outbound tourism, authors found that there was still a net positive effect, with an overall increase in spending in the economy through a higher number of international arrival bednights in the region. Travel went from around 600,000 in both directions at the start to 1.2 million international travellers into Porto and 700,000 outbound travellers[^66].

This approach offers a mechanism to stabilize the nation's external balances. A potential concern people might have of increased connectivity is the outflow of foreign currency if Maldivians use these cheap routes to travel abroad frequently for shopping or medical care. However, the geography of this proposal mitigates that risk. For the majority of the Maldivian population living in the central region (Malé and surroundings), traveling to Hanimaadhoo to catch a budget flight adds significant time and domestic transfer costs, negating the savings, which means that the market access to and from Hanimaadhoo Airport would be just the Northern Region of the Maldives and several major Indian cities respectively.

Therefore, these routes would naturally be dominated by inbound Indian tourists bringing foreign currency *in*, rather than locals taking it *out*. To capture this benefit, the government could institute a standing fiscal rule: a fixed share of the tax receipts and foreign currency earnings generated from this specific northern zone could be routed directly into a northern region development fund, the SDF, or toward debt repayments and reserves. This ensures that the high volume generated by the northern hub converts directly into the external financial stability required to service national debt and defend the currency peg.

#### Risks and safeguards

This strategy is not risk-free. Low-cost carriers are aggressive in chasing margins. They move aircraft quickly when routes underperform or when fees and terms change. There is also a long history of regional airports that expanded for expected traffic which never fully arrived. Since Hanimaadhoo Airport has already been largely developed with that capital expenditure being completed already, the risk of adding heavy capital costs on expansion projected for LCC growth is not quite the same – the baseline whether or not we have LCC growth will be the current airport structure. That said, it is important to design this approach in a way that gives it the best chance of success while avoiding potential pitfalls or consequences.

For one, incentives for airlines should be transparent, time-bound and limited in scope. Any discounts or waivers on aeronautical fees should be framed as a pilot programme for a fixed period, with a scheduled review once load factors and route performance are visible. There should be no open-ended per-passenger subsidies or guarantees that expose the budget to large contingent liabilities. It would also be best to be cautious about further capital expenditure even if early projections are strong – we should follow conservative demand scenarios rather than the most optimistic projections. The upgrade already carried out gives us a solid base for narrow-body operations. Further expansion beyond that should only proceed once we see sustained traffic data and a diversified mix of airlines and routes.

Cheaper outbound fares will also change behaviour at the margin for locals. We should assume some increase in Maldivian outbound travel for shopping, health care and leisure, even with geographic frictions described above where the additional domestic travel costs would the cheaper international fare not worth it for those in the central areas around Male’ or the Southern regions where the bulk of the Maldivian population would be, limiting the potential increase in outbound travel will more often come from Maldivians based in the North. The right goal is not to eliminate such trips, but to ensure that net foreign exchange inflows from inbound passengers remain far larger than any extra outflows. This is another reason to commit to an early review of traffic and FX data.

Aviation growth does bring local environmental and social impacts. Flight paths, noise footprints, traffic around the airport and pressure on nearby housing all need to be managed. Environmental impact assessments and local planning around the airport should be treated as integral rather than an afterthought.

#### Conclusion

Ultimately, this is a strategy to capitalize on a unique economic window. The rapid wealth accumulation of the Indian middle class, occurring before their population ages, represents a specific historical opportunity. By positioning Hanimaadhoo as the specialized gateway for this demographic, we could secure a second engine of growth for the Maldives — one that brings development to the north not through government handouts, but through the sheer economic gravity of a neighbouring giant.
