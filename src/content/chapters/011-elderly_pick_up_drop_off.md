# Elderly shuttle service for social participation

## Loneliness as a public health crisis

Elderly loneliness has emerged as one of the defining public health challenges of our time — with some studies suggesting health effects comparable to smoking fifteen cigarettes a day. Research consistently links social isolation and loneliness among older adults with significantly increased risks of cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression, and premature mortality. The US Surgeon General declared loneliness an epidemic in 2023, and countries from the UK to Japan have appointed ministers or developed national strategies specifically to address isolation. This is a structural outcome of how modern societies are organized, not a problem of individual failure or family neglect. As populations age, as family sizes shrink, as adult children work longer hours, and as urban environments are built around vehicles rather than walkability, the conditions that once naturally produced social interaction have eroded. Elderly people who would have encountered neighbours, shopkeepers, and community members in the course of daily life now often spend days without meaningful human contact.

## Transport as the binding constraint in the Maldives

Many elderly Maldivians live with their adult children, which provides crucial support but does not automatically solve the problem of social participation outside the home. Without personal vehicles, elderly residents must rely on family transport or expensive taxis. Adult children have work commitments, and many elderly individuals — out of consideration for their families — are reluctant to ask for help travelling somewhere for personal enjoyment unless it feels absolutely necessary. This is a completely understandable instinct: you don't want to be a burden, you don't want to interrupt someone's workday for something that feels optional, so you just stay home. With motorcycles being the predominant private vehicle in the Greater Malé area, many older people cannot safely use this mode of transport at all, further restricting their options.

The result is a structural gap that is easy to miss: we have built community spaces and programs for elderly participation without building the transport links that would allow isolated elderly to actually reach them. Spaces like Israhvehinge Naadhee exist, but those who currently visit are more likely to be elderly who already have more social connections and mobility options — the people who need these spaces least. The most isolated, the ones who would benefit most, often cannot get there.

## A dedicated shuttle connecting elderly to community life

The proposal is a dedicated elderly pick-up and drop-off shuttle service that closes this transport gap. The specific vehicle arrangements matter less than the service design: this could work through dedicated minibuses from public transport operators, vehicles owned by the coordinating government agency, partnerships with taxi companies, or some combination. Booking would be simple — through a hotline, app, or integration with existing transport apps — with flexible routes and scheduling based on actual demand rather than fixed timetables. The service would connect elderly residents to community spaces: elderly centres, libraries, accessible beach areas, parks, partner cafes and community spaces, medical facilities, or even just a drive around the city for mental well-being. Verification would require only an ID card, with full leeway for elderly who forget or cannot present identification, because the point is to serve people rather than to enforce bureaucratic compliance. Drivers would receive training on working with elderly passengers.

This complements physical infrastructure investments in elderly-friendly spaces. It is one thing to create wheelchair-accessible beach areas extending to the waterline (as France's Handi-plage program has done since 1999, with smooth pathways, beach wheelchairs, trained support staff, and accessible facilities), comfortable seating in public spaces, shaded areas, and organized activities. It is another thing entirely to ensure that elderly residents can actually reach these spaces. The shuttle closes that gap — and as a relatively modest intervention, it addresses elderly isolation through improved mobility rather than expecting families to solve the problem on their own. Offering transport options that do not require dependence on adult children is empowering: it supports elderly autonomy and dignity while relieving pressure on working families and maintaining traditional living arrangements. Regular social engagement and physical activity are linked to better mental and physical health outcomes, and enabling elderly to participate in community life is preventive care as much as it is social policy.

This could be complemented by arrangements for urgent transport needs, not just for elderly but also for people with disabilities, children with medical conditions, and others in vulnerable situations, and collaboration with hospitals to utilize their vehicles for non-emergency medical transport when taxis are scarce. The goal across all of these measures is the same: ensuring that vulnerable groups have peace of mind in always being able to meet their needs, rather than being left to navigate transport challenges alone.
