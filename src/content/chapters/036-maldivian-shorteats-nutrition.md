# What's actually in Maldivian shorteats? Nutrition estimates from kitchen measurements

Shorteats are a staple of Maldivian daily eating — served at tea time, sold at corner shops, brought to gatherings, eaten as snacks and sometimes as meals. Most people eat them regularly without giving much thought to what is in them nutritionally, and there is very little publicly available data on the actual nutritional content of Maldivian foods prepared in the way Maldivians actually prepare them. International food composition databases cover generic categories like "fried dough snack" or "tuna pastry," but these do not reflect the specific recipes, proportions, and methods used in a Maldivian kitchen.

We wanted to fill that gap for seven common shorteats: fuh gulha, handoo gulha, masroshi, kulhi boakibaa, kavaabu, havaadhulee bis, and bajiyaa. Rather than relying on published recipes or estimated ingredient quantities, we asked a family member to prepare each shorteat the way they normally would, and used a food scale to measure every ingredient as it went in. For deep-fried items, we weighed the shorteats before and after frying to calculate how much oil was actually absorbed during cooking — a number that is usually just estimated in nutrition databases but that makes a significant difference to the fat and calorie content of the finished product. Nutrient values for each ingredient were then calculated from USDA food composition data and a Felivaru-style tuna label for the macros of canned tuna used in most fillings.

The results are interesting for several reasons. Some shorteats that feel like light snacks are more calorie-dense than people might expect, largely because of oil uptake during frying. The sodium content adds up fast when you eat several pieces, which most people do. And the micronutrient profile of most shorteats is thin — they deliver calories and some protein from tuna, but leave significant gaps in fiber, potassium, folate, calcium, and a broader spread of vitamins that the rest of the day's diet needs to make up for.

**How to read the tables**

- **Per piece** = nutrients in one shorteat piece (the most useful column for most people).
- **%RDA (3 pcs)** = percent of recommended daily intake provided by three pieces, a typical serving.
- **Per 100 g** is included for cross-food comparison.

## Methods and key assumptions

**Ingredient quantities.** All ingredient quantities were measured by weight using a food scale during actual preparation by a home cook, not taken from published recipes. Where recipes call for "to taste" amounts (especially salt), we measured the amount actually used.

**Frying oil absorption.** For deep-fried items, we weighed pieces before and after frying to determine actual oil uptake. This is more accurate than the standard approach of modeling oil absorption from published yield factors, though some variation is inevitable depending on oil temperature, frying time, and how tightly dough is sealed. Our measured absorption figures ranged from roughly 14–17% of cooked weight depending on the item, which is consistent with published research on fried stuffed snacks.

**Cooking yield.** Masroshi (pan-cooked/roasted) and kulhi boakibaa (baked) were also weighed before and after cooking to determine moisture loss. Havaadhulee bis was modeled at a yield factor of 1.00 since it is boiled dough plus curry sauce with minimal net weight change.

**Tuna.** For canned tuna, edible drained weight per can is modeled as 120 g. Valhoamas (smoked tuna), used in masroshi and handoo gulha, is modeled as a bonito-style smoked tuna product with high protein and moderate sodium — the largest uncertainty in those two items is the grams-per-cup conversion for smoked tuna, which varies depending on how finely it is shredded.

**Nutrient database.** Per-100g nutrient values are from USDA food composition data (accessed via MyFoodData Tools) and a Felivaru-style tuna label for calories, protein, and fat. Micronutrients for canned tuna are approximated using the closest USDA entries when brand-specific data is unavailable.

## Micronutrient gaps and what they mean

Most shorteats are built from refined starch (wheat flour or rice), added fat (deep-frying oil and/or coconut), and a modest amount of protein from tuna. That combination tends to be calorie-dense while still leaving gaps in fiber, potassium, folate, calcium, and a broader spread of vitamins unless the rest of the day's diet is intentionally built around vegetables, fruit, legumes, and micronutrient-rich proteins.

Sodium is often the most immediate concern. Even small pieces can add up quickly if several are eaten at once, and salty fillings plus dipping sauces push totals higher. Over time, higher sodium intake raises population risk of hypertension and stroke, especially when paired with low potassium intake from insufficient fruit and vegetable consumption and low overall dietary fiber.

Saturated fat is mostly driven by coconut (and coconut milk in havaadhulee bis). Saturated fat is not toxic in itself, but when it crowds out unsaturated fats and fiber-rich foods across the week, blood-lipid profiles tend to move in an unfavorable direction for many people. Deep-frying raises total fat further through oil uptake, even when the pot holds far more oil than the food ultimately absorbs.

Risk and priorities differ by group. Women of reproductive age and pregnant women have higher iron and folate needs, and low intake increases risk of iron-deficiency anemia and poor pregnancy outcomes — tuna helps with B12 and protein, but many shorteats still land low on iron and folate density unless complemented. Children and adolescents need nutrient density more than sheer calories, and frequent calorie-dense snacks can displace iron-, calcium-, and vitamin-rich meals. Older adults need protein but high sodium and energy density can worsen hypertension, edema, or cardiometabolic risk, especially when activity levels are low. For people with diabetes or cardiometabolic risk, portion size matters, and pairing shorteats with fiber and protein from other sources helps blunt glycemic load and improves satiety.

Practical complements to balance out the overall day: bananas, papaya, guava, citrus, leafy greens, okra, pumpkin, and beans or lentils for potassium and fiber; lentils, chickpeas, leafy greens, fortified grains, and eggs for iron and folate (pairing plant iron with vitamin C foods for absorption); dairy, canned fish with bones, fortified milks, and calcium-set tofu for calcium; and more fresh fish, nuts, seeds, and unsaturated cooking oils for omega-3 and unsaturated fats.
