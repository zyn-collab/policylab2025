**Geopolitics and geo-economics**

The international order is shifting toward a more multipolar and transactional configuration. The United States remains influential but its relative weight continues to shrink, while China's role grows through finance, infrastructure investments, standards-setting, and control of clean-technology supply chains. For small states like the Maldives, this environment rewards issue-based coalitions and disciplined bargaining rather than alignment for its own sake. Industrial policy has become the new foreign policy: clean energy hardware, semiconductors, and critical minerals are now strategic assets, and tariffs, export controls, and friend-shoring arrangements will move faster than formal treaties. Market access and standards compliance are bargaining chips the Maldives can trade for finance and resilience support.

South-South dynamics matter more than they once did. India's expanding middle class drives travel, health, and education demand across the region, while Africa's energy leapfrogging and digital services growth create new southbound commercial lanes. Partnerships that once ran exclusively north-south now run both ways. Meanwhile, traditional aid is shrinking while climate finance grows larger but more complex to access. Deals will increasingly hinge on bankable projects, baseline data, and credible maintenance plans rather than political promises. Grant funding is thinning out while blended finance, guarantees, and carbon-linked instruments are expanding, which means the Maldives needs to build the project preparation capacity to access these new flows.

Security risks have become diffuse in ways that do not fit traditional categories. Gray-zone pressure, cyber incidents, and supply shocks can disrupt fuel, food, and medicines without a single identifiable conflict event. Resilience has become a logistics problem as much as a diplomatic one, and the Maldives needs to build redundancy into critical systems rather than relying solely on alliance relationships to guarantee security.

**Energy, climate technology, and adaptation**

Cheap solar panels, battery storage, and electric vehicle components will keep coming as China's manufacturing dominance keeps hardware prices low (though volatile). For small island developing states, the strategic opportunity lies in distributed generation plus storage at building and neighbourhood scale to cut electricity bills and keep services running during grid outages. This is not about competing with industrial-scale renewable projects but about building resilience into the fabric of communities.

Adaptation is fundamentally local and continuous rather than something that happens through headline projects. Shade structures, improved ventilation, and flood management on streets, in clinics, and in schools do more for heat stress and public health than occasional large infrastructure announcements. These should be treated as public works with clear standards and annual budgets rather than as one-off interventions. Climate diplomacy remains a survival strategy: grouping with other climate-exposed states can unlock concessional finance, debt swaps tied to adaptation outcomes, and faster access to clean-technology supply chains. The value of this diplomacy shows up at home in water security, coastal protection, and urban cooling.

Data and maintenance capacity will determine whether infrastructure investments pay off or become stranded assets. Sensors for groundwater levels, urban heat, and storm surge, paired with funded maintenance contracts, are the difference between resilient infrastructure and expensive failures. Oil supply and prices remain genuinely uncertain: projections have long discussed oil running out in major fields, but later discoveries and new extraction methods like fracking seem to guarantee oil rigs will keep running for the foreseeable future. The Maldives faces uncertainty from multiple directions—some countries' oil fields drying up, others tapping into new reserves, the boom in cheap renewables, and some countries rapidly decarbonizing while others rapidly industrialize—all of which reinforces the case for reducing fuel import dependence where possible.

**Demography, migration, and society**

The Maldives will age significantly over the coming decades. Longer lives and lower fertility rates will raise demand for primary care, assistive technology, and community programs that prevent isolation among the elderly. Seniors colleges and local day-care for elders can delay expensive institutional care while maintaining quality of life. Meanwhile, neighbouring countries still have a window of demographic dividend: India and parts of South Asia will have large working-age populations, which means more regional tourists, more students, more remote-service providers—and also more competition for skilled workers.

Mixed families and non-citizen residents will continue to increase. Non-Maldivians living, working, and marrying in the country will keep rising, and clear routes to long-term residency and citizenship (along with access to schools and clinics) are necessary to avoid shadow populations and the social friction that comes with them. Youth trust in institutions is fragile: online radicalization pathways, job precarity, and housing stress can feed disillusionment with the political system and with society more broadly. A youth work-experience guarantee, transparent queues for housing and benefits, and visible timelines for government services would help rebuild confidence among younger Maldivians who feel the system does not work for them.

**Health, risk, and preparedness**

Non-communicable diseases remain the quiet emergency. Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity strain health budgets more than acute outbreaks, and addressing them requires food policy interventions, active transport infrastructure, and default-healthy options in schools and workplaces—these matter as much as hospital capacity for long-term health outcomes. Post-COVID habits should become permanent tools: better ventilation, far-UVC deployment in high-risk settings, and mask-when-ill norms all lower transmission of many pathogens and help keep clinics below surge capacity.

The next pandemic could happen at any time, and preparedness requires stockpiles, vendor-managed inventory arrangements, and drone logistics for inter-island movement to shorten response times. Running drills, funding maintenance, and publishing readiness dashboards are as important as the physical infrastructure itself. Mental health has become core infrastructure rather than a secondary concern: urban noise, heat, and crowding increase anxiety and depression, and quiet streets, shade, sport spaces, and fast access to counselling should be understood as prevention measures rather than amenities.

GLP-1 agonists (such as Ozempic) are changing demand patterns globally. If access widens, the Maldives should expect shifts in obesity and diabetes care, surgical demand, and even tourism and hospitality offerings. Planning for supply, regulation, and public guidance on these drugs should happen now rather than reactively after widespread unmonitored use.

**Urban form, transport, and housing**

Pavements should be for people, not parking. Clearing sidewalks, managing curb space, and creating continuous shade reduces heat exposure, improves mobility for parents and elders and people with disabilities, and boosts small retail activity. Two-wheeler dominance is a policy choice, not fate: reliable bus or shuttle service, protected lanes, and dense e-bike and e-moped sharing systems can make private vehicle ownership optional and cut crashes and pollution in the process.

Housing supply is the master lever for multiple social problems. Scarcity drives crowding, stress, and clientelism. Building mixed-income, high-quality units at scale with transparent allocation and live public waitlists, paired with upkeep standards and pro-tenant enforcement, would address housing affordability while reducing the political economy of patronage that currently surrounds housing allocation. Streets should be understood as climate adaptation infrastructure: cool roofs, tree canopies, permeable surfaces, and flood routes lower temperatures and protect clinics and schools. These should be treated as standards built into all street works rather than pilot projects.

**Economy and industry structure**

Diversification should build around comparative advantages. Tourism remains central to the Maldivian economy, but adjacent pillars can be developed: health-and-wellness stays, education and training weeks, blue-economy processing, and maker hubs for spare parts and light repair. Remote services and digital residency programs offer another path: structured visas and digital company formation can bring foreign income to islands without expanding the state payroll, so long as these programs require local spending, training slots, and clear dispute resolution mechanisms.

Blue economy development can work if backed by strict monitoring, biosecurity protocols, QR-traceable supply chains, and on-island processing so that value stays local rather than being exported as raw materials. Sea-pen aquaculture and reef-safe products have potential, but only with proper oversight. A gateway to India's middle class through a northern low-cost travel hub with predictable fares and medical-check or training packages could turn short hops into repeat trips and diversify tourism geographically. Public procurement can serve as industrial policy: standardized parts, open frameworks, and maintenance-first contracts grow local firms and cut downtime in power, water, and health infrastructure.

**Digital state, AI, and rights**

AI is becoming embedded everywhere, which makes governance rules essential. Requirements should include disclosure for high-stakes automated decisions, watermarking of evidence used by the state, and keeping an accountable human responsible for consequential decisions. Banning harms we already understand (such as non-consensual intimate deepfakes) is straightforward and should be done. A single digital stack with less discretion would improve service delivery: one login, shared data standards, live case tracking, and points-based queues for housing, jobs, and benefits would reduce the role of fixers and speed up services for everyone.

Trust should be the key performance indicator for digital government. Publishing service backlogs and decision criteria, and time-stamping every step in a process, allows people to accept delays if they can see where they stand and why. Skills and safety nets need to be designed for the AI transition: short, modular upskilling programs, grants for process automation in small and medium enterprises, and portable benefits for gig workers help ensure that productivity gains from new technology are broadly shared rather than concentrated.

**Governance and political economy**

Clientelism runs on discretion and scarcity. Unlimited public sector job creation, slow services, and opaque project selection create demand for political favours. Capping roles, standardizing recruitment, and scoring projects with public criteria would change the underlying incentives that drive patronage politics. Opening the books in useful ways matters: publishing project scores, contract performance, maintenance backlogs, and readiness metrics, while naming the responsible unit and dating the next update, creates accountability that audits alone cannot achieve.

When services become rule-bound and fast, elected officials can say no to personal favour pipelines and spend their time on oversight and strategy instead. Parliamentary focus can shift back to policy when the pressure to intervene in individual cases decreases. This requires building systems where discretion is minimized and transparency is maximized, so that politicians are not caught between constituent demands and proper process.

**Finance, debt, and external balances**

Tight budgets will persist alongside rising expectations. Debt service and import bills squeeze room for new programs, which means prioritizing projects that cut operating costs (energy, maintenance, logistics) and have measurable savings. Blended finance instruments should be used with discipline: guarantees, swaps, and climate windows are useful, but they need to be tied to asset registers, maintenance funding, and performance data. Accepting gifts that raise future operations and maintenance costs without corresponding revenue is a trap.

Dollar stress is structural rather than cyclical. Tourism cycles and import dependence make foreign exchange buffers essential. Expanding local renewable generation and building local repair and parts ecosystems can chip away at import bills over time, but this requires sustained investment rather than one-off projects.

**Food, water, and materials**

Vulnerable supply chains can be shortened through more local cold storage, standardized crate sizes, and digitized procurement for schools and hospitals. These measures stabilize demand and encourage local producers. Water security should be treated as a national program with rain capture, leak detection, and redundancy in reverse osmosis plants, all backed by sensors and maintenance contracts that reduce drought and outage risk.

Circularity should become habit rather than slogan. Repair hubs, spare-part printing, and standardized components cut downtime and imports while building local skills. Government-owned 3D printing and domestic expertise means less reliance on importing rare and expensive spare parts, lowering downtimes on everything from medical diagnostics to customs processing equipment.

**Information integrity and social cohesion**

Faster truth beats louder truth. Standing rapid-response teams that publish verified updates during storms, outbreaks, and disruptions can beat rumour cycles before they spiral. Civic spaces matter for social cohesion: libraries, cafes, and small cultural venues give people places to gather that are not roads or malls. This lowers the temperature on political disputes and improves daily life. Education should prepare citizens for the messy internet: media literacy, source checking, and respectful debate should be graded skills from early secondary school, helping counter disinformation and polarization before they take hold.

**What this means for the briefs that follow**

Each sector brief should be anchored in three principles: operational resilience (including maintenance, stockpiles, and logistics), credible finance (with lifecycle costs and measurable savings), and trust-building delivery (through transparent queues and live tracking). Housing supply, local energy, and fast digital services should be treated as cross-cutting enablers that ease pressure on health, education, and policing rather than as standalone sectors. Climate diplomacy and south-south commercial links should fund and supply what only the state can do: coastal protection, water security, and heat and flood adaptation in streets and public buildings.

Youth pathways and elder supports need to be built now, with visible timelines, to stabilize expectations in an aging society. A rights-first digital and AI stance should ensure that innovation helps ordinary people and does not erode due process. These are not just technical policy considerations but fundamental orientations that should shape how every sector-specific proposal is designed and evaluated.

#### Futurist warnings

These are trends and risks highlighted by a variety of bodies planning for and projecting the issues of the future. They represent a synthesis of foresight work from organizations including the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report, the EU's Knowledge4Policy foresight hub, the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, UNDP's Foresight Playbook, the OECD's long-run economic scenarios, UNESCO's futures of education work, and the US Director of National Intelligence's Global Trends reports.

Technological change continues to accelerate alongside hyperconnectivity, with AI diffusing across sectors while governance frameworks and labour market adjustments struggle to keep pace. Information integrity has emerged as a top near-term risk, with mis- and disinformation identified by the World Economic Forum as among the most immediate threats globally. Looking further ahead, adverse outcomes from frontier technologies (including AI, biotechnology, and brain-computer interfaces) rank as significant ten-year risks. The changing nature of work and skills, mixed-age labour forces, and automation pressure are reshaping employment patterns across economies. Digital public infrastructure—identity systems, payment rails, and data standards—has become a critical enabler of state capacity. At the same time, cyber espionage and warfare persist as threats that grow alongside hyperconnectivity, and the rising risk of biotech misuse is being amplified by AI capabilities.

Climate change is escalating, with the 1.5°C breach threshold increasingly likely and compounding hazards intensifying. Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss are emerging as dominant ten-year horizon concerns, while extreme weather events register as top long-term global risk signals. Resource scarcity across water, food, energy, land, and minerals is aggravating, and plastics and waste volumes are projected to surge through 2060 without stronger policy intervention, driving both circularity imperatives and critical-materials competition. Urbanization continues, with secondary cities particularly exposed to heat and flood risks. Health challenges are shifting toward non-communicable diseases and mental health under climate and urban stress, while heat-health impacts, vector-borne diseases, and coastal risks compound as climate threats.

Demographic trends point toward super-ageing in many countries, with dependency ratios rising and care-economy expansion becoming necessary. Global fertility decline makes peak population within this century plausible. Migration is becoming more significant, with diverse drivers and high policy sensitivity, while involuntary displacement from conflict and climate shapes migration flows. Growing consumerism from an expanding middle class increases demand for goods and services, with higher food, water, and energy demand absent significant behavioural or technological shifts.

The international order is fragmenting, with multipolar contestation becoming the baseline assumption. State-based armed conflict has returned to the top of near-term risk rankings, and geoeconomic confrontation through trade restrictions, sanctions, and industrial policy continues to intensify. Supply-chain bloc formation and separate silos represent plausible future scenarios, alongside alternative world trajectories ranging from renaissance of democracies to competitive coexistence to tragedy and mobilization. Societal polarization and inequality have emerged as central, cross-cutting risks, with erosion of civic freedoms and human rights appearing in some forecast pathways. Trust in institutions continues to decline, highlighting the need for anticipatory governance that can respond to emerging challenges before they become crises.

Pandemic risk persists, making stockpiles and logistics structural needs rather than one-off preparations. Education faces calls for a new social contract emphasizing lifelong learning and digital civics, while knowledge societies require bridging participation and capacity gaps. Long-run economic growth faces slowdown from ageing unless labour participation and migration rise, and energy-transition costs must be weighed against long-run avoided damages. Urban adaptation standards for cooling, flood routes, and nature-based solutions are increasingly recognized as essential, alongside coastal protection and water security as frontline priorities for small island developing states.

Digital governance requires one-stop services, shared data standards, and ethical AI use, while cyber-physical risks grow with hyperconnectivity across infrastructure and data systems. Supercharged online harms including harassment and deepfakes are shaping both politics and markets. Fiscal tightness amid higher expectations makes prioritizing operations, maintenance, and savings essential. Climate finance has become complex, with blended and guarantee instruments overtaking classic aid flows. The plastics treaty remains uncertain, with lifecycle regulation debates ongoing. Middle-class growth in Asia continues to reshape consumption and travel demand, while urban mobility transitions toward electric vehicles, micromobility, and reliable public transport. Security paradigms are shifting toward hybrid threats and gray-zone tactics. Throughout, maintenance, data, and preparedness have emerged as the operating system of resilience, with long-horizon scenarios showing wide uncertainty bands and high policy sensitivity.
