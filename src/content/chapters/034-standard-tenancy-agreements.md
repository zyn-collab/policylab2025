Similarly to how business registration in the Maldives now requires submission of a standardized template for the Articles of Association, all rental agreements can be required to include the standard tenancy agreement template and be registered online with the respective government entity or council.

Rentals being registered online with relevant documentation guarantees protections and acts as a demonstration of good faith by the landlord. It is the responsibility of the landlord to file paperwork and register tenancy. Rental contracts signed after the implementation of this regulation without the landlord registering said agreements online will result in the landlord bearing the burden of proof in tenancy disputes. Where tenants are asked or pressured to sign off on tenancy without completing the standard agreement and registration, tenants can file a complaint for investigation by the relevant authority.

This agreement is intended to be enforceable under current law. Where existing law applies, the stricter protection takes precedence. References to the Residential Tenancy Act (21/2021) of the Maldives are included.

AGREEMENT

**Date:** \_\_\_ / \_\_\_ / 20\_\_

**Landlord:** \[Full name, ID/Passport, service address for notices, phone/email\]

Landlord must disclose legal name and service address in writing.

**Tenant(s):** \[Full name(s), ID/Passport(s), phone/email\]

**Premises:** \[Address, unit/room\]; \[parking/storage/common areas if any\]

**Use:** Residential only. No unlawful activity.

1\. Term, Rent, Payment, Receipts

- **Type:** ☐ Fixed term \[Start\]–\[End\] ☐ Month-to-month (start \[Date\]).

- **Rent:** MVR \[AMOUNT\] per month, due on the \[DAY\].

- **Late fee:** Only after 7 days overdue; cap MVR \[X\] or \[X\]% of monthly rent, whichever is lower (no compounding).

- **Receipts:** Tenant may request a signed, dated receipt for any rent or other amount paid; landlord must provide it free of charge.

- **No illegal/add-on charges:** No key/application/“processing” fees or other extras beyond rent, the agreed Security Deposit (Section 2) and optional Advance Payment (Section 3). *(Illegal additional charges are barred by the Tenancy Act 21/2021).*

2\. Security Deposit (Escrowed)

- Security deposit cannot be more than one month’s rent.

- Where held: In escrow in a Rent Board escrow account or other approved escrow, registered with the Board. Funds are released at end of tenancy to the party entitled.

- Use: May be applied only to lawful deductions at the end of tenancy: unpaid rent then due, unpaid tenant-obligation utilities, and damage beyond normal wear with itemised invoices.

- Inspection-linked release: Within 14 days of move-out, landlord must deliver an itemised statement and propose deposit release. If both parties sign the joint inspection form, escrow must release accordingly within 3 business days.

- If dispute on inspection/deductions: Either party may:

  1.  ask Local Council to appoint an independent inspector and issue a written recommendation; if both sides accept, escrow releases per that recommendation;

  2.  if either side rejects the recommendation, apply to the Rent Board for an order; Board orders are binding and enforceable.

  3.  parties retain the right to seek a court determination if unsatisfied with Board outcomes (preserved right under general law; also consistent with Board/court split in the Act).

- Offence backstop (contract mirror): Requiring or mishandling deposits contrary to the Act is an offence; this contract makes such mishandling a material breach as well.

3\. Advance Payment

- Optional: Tenant may choose to pay Advance Rent of \[N\] months directly to the landlord at signing; this is not a security deposit.

- Effect on notice: Tenant may give \[N\] months’ notice, and the advance is applied to those final \[N\] months of rent. During that notice period no further monthly rent is due (unless rent increases by agreement or law).

- No double-dipping: Landlord cannot demand more than one month Security Deposit and also demand “advance” that effectively exceeds the lawful structure in the Tenancy Act 21/2021; if advance is paid, it is only a prepayment of rent and may not be treated as a penalty or fee.

4\. Landlord Duties

- Keep the premises in a good state of repair and fit for habitation; comply with health, safety, housing, and maintenance standards (water, sanitation, safe structure, smoke/CO detectors, etc).

- Do not withhold or interfere with vital services (water, electricity) or essential documents; maintain standards of space, ventilation, and light.

- Quiet enjoyment: No substantial interference with normal use; no harassment.

- Repairs timeline: Once tenant reports in writing, landlord will start urgent/safety repairs within 48 hours and other repairs within 7 days, and complete within a reasonable period.

5\. Tenant Duties

- Pay rent on time; ordinary cleanliness; take reasonable care; report defects promptly; follow reasonable, written House Rules that don’t contradict this agreement; do not harass the landlord.

6\. Privacy & Entry

- Entry without notice: emergencies or tenant’s consent at the time; permitted housekeeping where the agreement requires, within hours stated.

- Entry with notice: at least 24 hours’ written notice, 8:00–20:00, stating date, window, and purpose (repairs/inspection/insurer/mortgagee/purchaser).

- To show to new tenants: 24-hour advance notification, 8:00–20:00.

- No photographing personal effects except as needed to document repairs or condition.

7\. Rent Increases & Reductions

- Increases only as permitted by law; not more than once every 12 months and with proper notice. *(Mirrors Part VI rules.)*

- Mandatory reductions / abatements where included services are reduced or the Board orders a reduction tied to unresolved serious maintenance breaches.

8\. Illegal Fees

- Any amount collected that constitutes an illegal charge must be repaid; this agreement treats such collection as a breach with refund and damages.

9\. Condition Report, Keys, and Move-out

- Move-in condition report with dated photos is annexed and signed.

- Move-out: Tenant returns all keys/fobs; normal wear and tear is not chargeable.

- Deceased tenant: If sole tenant dies, tenancy deemed terminated 30 days after death; landlord must safeguard property and allow estate/family reasonable access.

10\. Assignment, Subletting, Guests

- Guests: Up to \[X\] days in any 3-month period; beyond this requires consent.

- Assignment/Subletting: Allowed with landlord consent not unreasonably withheld; reasons for refusal must be given in writing within 7 days.

11\. Safety / Family Violence Protections

- Tenant may end the tenancy early with a confidential 28-day notice if the tenant or a child has experienced violence/abuse; locks must be changed or allowed to be changed within 48 hours. *(Mirrors the Act’s protection architecture.)*

12\. Security of Tenure

- Termination only as per law or by written agreement; no “self-help” eviction, no seizure of tenant property without due process.

- Recovery of possession only after tenant vacates/abandons or by Board/court order.

- Landlord termination for non-payment or cause: must use proper notices with cure opportunities as set out in the Act (notice must state amount due and that payment before application voids notice).

- Bad faith notices: If found in bad faith, landlord is liable for specified sums/abatements/fines; this contract incorporates those remedies by reference.

13\. Notices

- Form and content: Notices must identify the unit, termination date, and be signed; landlord notices must state reasons and advise of the right to dispute.

- Periods: Daily/weekly: 28 days; Monthly: 60 days; Fixed: 60 days to expiry.

- Effect of payment after notice: Accepting arrears after notice doesn’t waive the notice unless agreed.

14\. Disputes & Remedies

- Parties first try to resolve in writing.

- **Board jurisdiction:** Either party may apply to the Rent Board, or if no such board exists as of time of conflict, meet with a court-appointed mediator/arbitrator or local council officials for orders including repairs, rent abatement, administrative fines, no-increase orders, termination, damages, and other appropriate orders.

- **Court:** Either party retains the right to seek court orders where applicable (eviction, damages, appeals).

15\. Privacy

- Landlord must never alter locks without giving replacement keys; tenant must not change locks without consent (consent not unreasonably withheld for safety).

- Landlord stores tenant data securely and uses it only for tenancy administration or as required by law.

16\. Rules of Agreement

- This agreement and annexes are the entire agreement. Any change must be in writing and signed.

- If any clause is unlawful, the rest stands.

- Both sides must mitigate their losses if the other breaches.

17\. Governing Law; Registration

- Governing law: Maldives.

- **Registration:** Parties will file a copy of this Standard Lease with the Rent Board, , or if no such board exists as of time of conflict, with the local council. If the required authorities cannot be reached, both parties can post their copies on \[public website\] as timestamped proof of agreement.
