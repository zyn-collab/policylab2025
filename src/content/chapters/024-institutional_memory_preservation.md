# Institutional memory and policy continuity

## The cost of lost knowledge across turnovers

Government agencies lose institutional memory in two ways. The first is ordinary staff turnover: people leave, retire, or transfer, and their knowledge of how things work, what has been tried, and why certain decisions were made leaves with them. The second is political turnover: every five years, a change in government can bring new leadership at the senior and political levels who were not present for the previous administration's work and have limited visibility into what was done, what worked, what failed, and why. In both cases, knowledge that should accumulate over time instead dissipates, and each new cohort of staff or leadership starts with an incomplete picture of what came before.

The consequences are predictable. Programs that were working well are discontinued not because they failed but because new leadership does not know they exist or does not understand their value. Programs that failed are repeated because no one remembers why they were abandoned. Initiatives are launched that duplicate work already underway in another department because no one has a comprehensive view of what the ministry is doing. New staff take months to become effective because there is no structured way to learn what the organization does beyond what their immediate colleagues happen to tell them. Consultants and new hires ask the same questions that were asked and answered years ago, and the answers have to be reconstructed from memory each time. These are predictable outcomes of organizations that have no systematic way to document and transmit what they know.

## Documentation as infrastructure for continuity

Public Policy Lab has been working with the Ministry of Social and Family Development to build the documentation infrastructure that makes institutional memory possible. The core of this effort is a comprehensive publication that documents all policies and programs being carried out across every department of the ministry — not just their existence, but their context, their implementation status, their challenges, and their results where available. For new staff, it functions as an onboarding resource that provides a complete picture of the ministry's work rather than the fragmented view they would otherwise piece together over months. For existing staff, it breaks down the silos that typically keep departments unfamiliar with each other's work — when everyone has access to a document describing what every department does, heads of department and individual staffers can identify complementary activities, avoid redundant work, and coordinate on shared needs like site visits that could serve multiple purposes.

For leadership transitions, this documentation provides something that rarely exists in government: a genuine handover. Incoming leadership can read a single document and understand what programs are underway, what their status is, what challenges they face, and what the reasoning was behind key decisions. They do not have to rely on briefings that may be incomplete or on institutional memory that may have already departed. Programs that were working well are visible and can be continued; programs that were struggling are documented along with the reasons, so new leadership can make informed decisions about whether to persist, adjust, or discontinue. The goal is not to constrain future governments — they remain free to set their own priorities — but to ensure they have the information needed to make good decisions rather than starting blind.

## Breaking silos through shared visibility

Beyond continuity across turnovers, comprehensive documentation addresses the silo problem that affects most large organizations. Ministries are divided into departments, and departments often have limited visibility into each other's work. One department conducts site visits to islands without knowing that another department needs information from those same islands — so two trips happen when one could have served both purposes. One department develops a data collection system without knowing that another department already built something similar. One department identifies a systemic issue through casework without a clear channel to share that finding with colleagues working on related policy. The fragmentation is not caused by unwillingness to collaborate but by the absence of infrastructure that would make collaboration natural — people cannot coordinate on work they do not know exists.

When a single publication documents the work of every department and is shared ministry-wide, these silos become harder to maintain. Staff can see what their colleagues in other departments are working on, identify overlaps and opportunities for coordination, and flag when their work connects to someone else's. This requires the documentation to actually be comprehensive and to actually be shared — not a report that sits in a folder but a living reference that everyone in the organization knows about and uses. The investment in producing and maintaining such documentation pays off not in visible outputs but in the accumulated efficiency gains of an organization that knows what it is doing across all its parts.
