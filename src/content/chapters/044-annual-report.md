Public Policy Lab was founded in May 2024 with a mission to advance the policy environment in the Maldives through rigorous research, data-driven solutions, and fostering a vibrant community of policy professionals. This report details our work from our inception through the end of 2025, a period of significant growth and impact. Despite operating with limited resources, we have made substantial strides in influencing policy conversations and contributing to the social and urban development of the Maldives.

Our work is made possible by the dedication of our team and the proceeds from our consultancy projects. While this model has allowed us to maintain our independence and agility, it also means our senior team's time is divided. The achievements outlined in this report, therefore, represent not our maximum potential, but a testament to our efficiency and commitment. With increased resources, we are confident in our ability to expand our work and deepen our impact in the years to come.

Our projects

Over the past year, Public Policy Lab has initiated and engaged in a diverse range of projects, from in-depth research to community-level engagement.

Affiliated entities

In projects or consultancies with a legal component, we partner with the firm Riffath & Shabeen LLP. For research or policy-centric projects with a strong legal component, we can do joint consultancies where the services of both firms can be utilized.

Partnerships

Collaboration is at the heart of our work. We have formalized our partnership with the National Library of Maldives through an official MOU, building on our pro-bono support for their policy development and strategic planning. We are also proud to have worked with the Ministry for Social and Family Development, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, Hulhumale Hospital, Australia AID, and UNICEF.

Financials

Our financial strategy in this early stage has been to maximize impact while minimizing overhead. For the activities of the Policy Lab, the annual expenses for 2025 are as follows:

| Category                             | MVR     | USD      |
|--------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| Rent and furnishing                  | 150,000 | 9740.26  |
| Wages (part-time Jan-Mar, Sep - Dec) | 90,000  | 5,844.15 |
| Deliverables-based pay               | 9,940   | 645.45   |
| Event equipment and hosting          | 2,647   | 171.88   |
| Website and hosting                  |         |          |
| Travel and accommodation for mapping |         |          |
| Print materials                      |         |          |
| Miscellaneous                        |         |          |
| Total expenses                       |         |          |
| Average monthly expenses             |         |          |

All funding for our policy work is currently derived from consulting revenue generated by partners. The salaries of our senior team are currently covered by this consulting revenue and are not reflected in the above expenses. This is an important consideration when comparing our budget to other organizations where senior staff are full-time employees.

However, we believe our output demonstrates an efficient use of resources and highlights the potential for greater impact with increased funding.

The island mapping expenses were funded through a research grant, with that research still ongoing and set to be published in 2026. Although around half of the intended expenses fell within 2025, output from that ongoing research is not covered in this publication.

From January 2026 onward, office premises are being rented for MVR 150,000 annually.

Website hosting, domain, workspace, and software subscriptions USD 1934 or MVR 29,822.32 annually

MVR 108,000 annually for salaries (not including shares in fees for consulting projects bid for jointly)

We are open to additional funding or investment that would allow us to retain full-time staff who can be fully dedicated to policy work instead of splitting their time between revenue-generating work and policy work. Our target expansion plans are initially two full-time expert employees and one part-time support employee in addition to the existing team, while continuing to use our current office space with a small event budget.

| Category                              | MVR        | USD       |
|---------------------------------------|------------|-----------|
| Wages (2 full-time employees, annual) | 443,520.00 | 28,800.00 |
| Wages (1 part-time employee, annual)  | 84,000.00  | 5,454.55  |
| Rent and furnishing                   | 150,000.00 | 9,740.26  |
| Website, workspace, and subscriptions | 29.822.32  | 1,934.00  |
| Event hosting and equipment           | 26,000.00  | 1,688.31  |
|                                       |            |           |

Future outlook

Due to the very small core team, scaling up by taking on additional consulting projects for further revenue was unfeasible over 2025. We have also focused a lot of resources on non-profit-making ventures over 2025. That said, we believe that we have established the Public Policy Lab name to a point where we are well suited to expand further, allowing us to scale up revenue generation beyond what could be done during these early stages.

We have also developed products which can be found in the Catalogue section for order by interested organizations or clients, as well as honed a range of services through experience over 2025 with our direct clients which we are now rolling out open to the public.

In 2026, we look forward to hiring. This expansion of our team will allow us to take on more revenue-generating consulting projects, as well as more ambitious Policy Lab projects and further increase our impact. If funding streams or revenue allows for faster growth, we may also hire additional employees, hold more events, and upgrade our premises to accommodate full-time in-office staff.

We are also considering a model of expanding through investment partnerships, which would allow us to scale up much more quickly from a larger base of capital. We will also continue to seek new partnerships and funding opportunities to allow us to transition to a model where we can dedicate ourselves more to policy-related work, unlocking our full potential to contribute to a better future for the Maldives.
