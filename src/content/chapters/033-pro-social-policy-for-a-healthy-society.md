Introduction

The Maldives has experienced rapid economic development, urbanisation, and population growth over recent decades. As with other small island developing states (SIDS), the Maldives faces challenges in sustainably meeting the evolving needs of larger and more complex communities under land constraints and high population density. A focus on economic and material development that can show concrete and quantifiable results can lead to a deprioritisation over decades of policies that tend to the social fabric of society through a more holistic development of communities and individuals. The role of policy in shaping society and cultural norms is often overlooked, especially in comparison to a comparable developmental success story like Singapore. Policies are lacking when it comes to an intentional and planned focus on intellectual, social, mental, emotional, moral, spiritual, artistic, and literary enrichment of communities and individuals to keep pace with the development of economic conditions.

There are many elements to a full policy suite toward this catching up of intellectual, cultural, and social development to keep pace with economic development. Many aspects of concrete economic and material development do play a role – availability of quality and affordable housing, more investment in teachers and schools, and more suitable job opportunities for youth are all material development that also drive cultural and social development. But even if cultural and social development can be capped by the level of material development, a lack of policies to directly target intellectual, cultural, and social development and the cultivation of a healthier society by encouraging positive trends and defusing toxic patterns, is leaving much on the table. We could compare this to how an individual might not be able to reach peak fitness without exercise, but even if they do exercise but also have a poor diet and a chain-smoking habit, they’ll see those improvements more slowly, have a lower ceiling on how healthy they can get, and develop unseen health issues that can destroy their health later down the line.

Policies to directly establish, inculcate, and promote positive social values and discourage negative ones might no longer be as in fashion as policies that try to develop conditions upstream to create an environment where these values can grow. Policymakers might worry that it might be too obvious or heavy-handed, or that the electorate might not be receptive to it and might find it preachy or condescending. There is often a tendency within policy circles to focus entirely on making changes upstream to try encourage specific choices by changing the ‘environment’ around them and shaping incentives, opportunities, or paths of least resistance – whether it’s changing the ‘business environment’ to encourage innovation, changing the ‘regulatory environment’ to unleash investment, changing the ‘urban environment’ or ‘built environment’ to encourage things like business districts or lower vehicle use, and so on.

We make this point to contextualize this policy approach as being part of a whole. As a comparison, we can see that modern policy ideas in the economic sector now pair an evolved version of old-school direct industrial policy alongside policies to develop the business, regulatory, investment, and legal environments. These upstream policies aren’t just left to be after initiation but are actively managed with the policymaking body overseeing and directing resources, inputs, processes, and outputs while carrying out public campaigns, marketing, facilitating, and other support activities to bring in the participants they want, whether it’s through outreach programs for youth, setting up internship programs to channel students into skill gap areas, or directly contacting and meeting foreign investors with proposals.

As for the direct public campaigns to shift social norms, the impact of behavioural campaigns to encourage positive habits and discourage behaviour with negative externalities on society was once a widely accepted, with massive success particularly in driving behavioural changes and shifting social norms for public health advancements. Much like old-school industrial policy, they fell out of fashion in recent decades in much of the world while they remained as key government policy in the likes of Singapore and China. Pro-social policy as seen in much of East and South East Asia may seem more subjective than those behavioural campaigns on public health issues, but from a Maslow’s hierarchy of needs point of view, well-being in a more economically developed society has shifted. Rather than cholera from not boiling water or infant malnutrition from a lack of breastfeeding, people in society experience isolation, atomization, a loss of community, financial anxieties, status insecurity, disillusionment, the pressure of constant competition and keeping up appearances, a lack of contact with nature, loneliness, persistent stress, environmental degradation, and more.

Governments in East and Southeast Asia have actively promoted specific values and etiquette as cornerstones of national identity. We discuss the roles that these values play across various countries such as Singapore, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and South Korea, focusing on how they are intertwined with nation-building efforts, cultural and historical underpinnings, and the broader implications for societal behaviour and international perception. We then contextualize how such a program might look for the Maldives.

Any attempt by the state to shape social norms has to stay within clear boundaries. It must respect basic rights, avoid coercion and leave space for pluralism and disagreement. The task here is not to enforce a single way of living. It is to support habits and expectations that make everyday life fairer, kinder and more workable for everyone. That implies a few guardrails. Campaigns should not criminalise private beliefs or turn differences of opinion into questions of loyalty. Tools such as fines and bans should be reserved for concrete harms, not for trying to police thought. The main tools of pro-social policy are positive: the way we design public spaces, the stories we tell in schools and media, the examples set by public figures and the repeated, consistent enforcement of a small number of rules that everyone understands.

Promoted values and their societal manifestations

In nations of East and Southeast Asia, the state has played a pivotal role in embedding values such as humility, community duty, and respect within the societal fabric. These values manifest in everyday etiquette like orderly conduct in public spaces, respectful interaction, and communal responsibility. For instance, practices such as not littering, maintaining public cleanliness, and showing deference to the elderly are not just encouraged but are seen as reflections of one’s moral character and national identity.

Post-independence and decolonization periods marked significant efforts by states to define national identity through prescribed behaviours and values. Countries such as Singapore and Malaysia have institutionalized 'Asian values' through education and public policy to foster a unified national character. These efforts are portrayed as essential for maintaining social order and political stability. The values promoted are deeply rooted in the cultural, historical, and religious narratives of each country. In Indonesia and Malaysia, Islamic teachings significantly influence the national ethos, advocating for modesty and communal support. Conversely, Confucian ideals in China and Japan emphasize filial piety and societal harmony, shaping public behaviour and state policies.

The discourse around these values often frames them as unique aspects of national character, contributing to a sense of national exceptionalism. This perspective posits that citizens of these nations are expected to uphold these values not only for personal integrity but as representatives of their national cultures on the global stage. Failure to adhere to these norms is often seen as a national embarrassment, reflecting poorly on the country’s image internationally. There is a prevailing narrative within these countries that modern behaviours can either uphold the greatness of their historical values or signal a decline in moral standards. This narrative is frequently used to critique anti-social modern behaviours, with governments urging a return to 'authentic' national values to combat perceived moral decay. Masculine values such as duty, protection of the vulnerable, and honour are highlighted, with national heroes and historical figures often cited as exemplars of these virtues. These figures are not only celebrated for their contributions to national defence but also for their adherence to ethical standards that supposedly epitomize the national character.

Governments employ various strategies for social engineering to reinforce these values, including public awareness campaigns, educational reforms, and public shaming for violations of public etiquette. These efforts are aimed at ensuring that the promoted values transcend personal behaviour and become ingrained in the national consciousness. The promotion of specific values and etiquette in East and Southeast Asia is placed within a clear context of nation-building that ties individual behaviours to broader national identities. Values, rooted in each country’s unique cultural, historical, and religious context, are continually reinforced through state policies and public discourse. The result is a distinctive blend of traditional norms and modern national identity, reflecting both the aspirations and the challenges of these societies.

Values as national identity

In countries like Japan and Singapore, values such as community duty and respect for others are deeply integrated as public messaging across society. For example, the practice of orderly queuing and punctuality in Japan is a reflection of deep cultural appreciation for respect and community harmony, profoundly ingrained through both educational systems and public policy. These practices are celebrated as virtues that uphold societal cohesion and are integral to the national identity.

Singapore has had versions of campaigns to promote a defined set of values and etiquette since In Singapore, the government’s campaigns to maintain public cleanliness and decorum, such as the Clean and Green campaign, extend beyond environmental concerns, touching on moral and civic responsibilities. These initiatives are rigorously enforced through laws and public education, showcasing the government's role in shaping behaviours that align with the broader goals of national identity and public health. It is worth noting that while people might point to traditional cultural norms having a focus on authority, etiquette, and honour in a country like Japan, that the societies resulting from public awareness campaigns do not actually reflect a direct cultural line from the past. Singapore, for example, was a small fishing village, and much of Singaporean identity and values were built effectively from scratch during the Lee Kuan Yew era. Much of China had enormous cultural upheaval during the Mao years including massive relocations between urban and rural populations and the Cultural Revolution, which meant that the cultural links to the past were significantly broken, and modern Chinese etiquette and cultural policy explicitly brought back a fusion of Confucian and communist ideals, with Confucian values and behaviour being promoted within China as a policy decision by the government.

The reinforcement of these values through policies has significant cultural implications. For instance, in Malaysia, public etiquette and cleanliness are tied to broader religious and cultural values, where Islamic teachings heavily influence the public policies on modesty and communal respect. These policies are not isolated but are part of a comprehensive approach to maintain cultural integrity and national pride.

Examples of humane social norms

The emphasis on public cleanliness in Singapore is a prime example of how everyday etiquette is institutionalized to reflect national values. Laws against littering and spitting are enforced with significant fines, reflecting the broader societal values of cleanliness, which are equated with moral and civic virtue. This policy has become deeply embedded in the national psyche, promoting a sense of shared responsibility and national pride.

In China, respect and social order is emphasized through both traditional Confucian teachings and modern civic education. This respect is manifested in everyday behaviours, from the deference shown to elders to the harmonious conduct in public spaces. The Chinese government actively promotes these values through educational curricula and public media, aiming to foster a cohesive society that aligns with the Confucian ideal of harmony as well as Communist ideals of communitarianism.

The widespread adherence to public etiquette in Japan, such as meticulous attention to recycling protocols and public cleanliness, has become symbolic as representing how Japanese people view themselves. Japanese citizens view these practices as integral to their identity and international reputation. The famous instance of Japanese fans cleaning stadiums after international football matches is a testament to how deeply these values are ingrained and the pride with which they are upheld on the global stage.

Values promoted by these governments are interwoven with each nation's history and cultural ethos. In Thailand and China, where Buddhist and Confucian ideals respectively play a significant role, the focus on harmony, respect for hierarchy, and filial piety permeates both public policy and everyday behaviour. These traditional values are reinforced through state ceremonies and educational policies. In Indonesia and Malaysia, Islamic principles of mutualism, neighbourliness, kindness, being welcoming to guests, and protecting the vulnerable are upheld through consistent messaging across government.

In Maldivian conditions this will often be very practical. It can mean long, patient campaigns on littering and waste, backed by well-designed bins and collection systems. It can mean normalising queuing, courtesy on ferries and buses, and a presumption that public spaces are for everyone, not only for those with connections. It can mean making it easier for people to volunteer, mentor younger people or contribute to local projects. These are small shifts, but over time they can change what feels normal and what feels unacceptable.

Intentionality in national mythmaking

National mythmaking refers to the deliberate construction of narratives, symbols, and historical accounts that shape the collective identity and consciousness of a nation. Especially prevalent during and after decolonization and independence movements, national mythmaking plays a crucial role in the nation-building process by fostering a sense of unity, pride, and purpose among citizens[^10]. Contrary to the term "myth" being associated with fiction or falsehood, in the context of national mythmaking, it refers to the creation of powerful, often simplified, and emotionally resonant stories that help define a nation's past, present, and future. These narratives may draw upon historical events, cultural traditions, heroic figures, and shared experiences to craft a cohesive and idealized version of national identity.

National mythmaking has multiple purposes. It serves to legitimize the authority of the newly established state by providing a historical narrative that justifies its existence and sovereignty. By glorifying the struggles and sacrifices of past leaders and freedom fighters, national myths imbue the nation with a sense of continuity and purpose, inspiring citizens to contribute to its development and defence. Secondly, national myths often seek to unify diverse populations by promoting a common heritage, language, and set of values. This cohesion is essential for fostering social stability and political solidarity, especially in multiethnic or multicultural societies where divisions and conflicts may arise.

National myths can instil a sense of pride and patriotism among citizens, fostering a collective consciousness that transcends individual interests and identities. By celebrating shared achievements and triumphs, national myths reinforce a sense of belonging and loyalty to the nation-state. National mythmaking is not a neutral or objective process. It often involves selective interpretation of historical events, glossing over uncomfortable truths, or even fabricating stories to serve political agendas or promote particular ideologies. As such, while national myths can be powerful tools for nation-building and fostering national identity, they can also perpetuate biases, exclusionary narratives, and harmful stereotypes. Therefore, critical engagement with national myths is essential for understanding the complexities of national identity and history.

Historically, versions of national legends such as the Muhammad Thakurufaanu story, although drawn from historical sources, have been somewhat streamlined and formalized into an “official” version as national legend. The goal of these were drawing from similar movements across in countries in similar historical situations as European colonialism withdrew after World War 2 and new states were formalized, and they have a clear purpose: creating a shared sense of national identity where citizens of the nation-state would have a common narrative conception of their own history and what led them here and what tied them together, one that would inspire them to feel patriotism toward the country rather than allegiance to other sub-units (for example, to Male’ for Male’ residents or to their islands or leaders – from historical sources, we see that in the early 20th century there was a clear difference in how Male’ residents viewed themselves compared to the remaining islands and how intentional national policies to change those mindsets were heavily prioritized in the Ameen Didi presidency).

National heroes in countries also often become cultural icons, representing ideals that transcend their historical contexts to become integral parts of national identity narratives. Their stories are used in educational curricula and public media to instil values such as loyalty, bravery, and self-sacrifice, which are seen as essential traits for both individual character and national integrity. Traditionally, the power of national legends comes from the universality of human nature over time and the timelessness of feelings and emotions shared by national heroes and any successive generation of a nation’s citizens. Returning resonance and relevance to national heroes by having them be moral inspirations and aspirational archetypes is necessary. National legends and folklore are fundamentally emotionally resonant, but the retelling of legends as purely history creates an ever-growing emotional remove as the everyday lives and contexts of Maldivians have changed. Retellings of these core myths in movies, skits, animations, and other forms of content designed to be high quality and easily accessible, that focus on the universal emotional elements and the inspirational aspects of national heroes are crucial to cultivating a sense of national identity. Through not cultivating national myths as sources of inspiration relevant to the modern day, and this disconnect where the stories of national heroes are not felt as emotionally resonant and relevant to modern citizens points to a gap in cultural education and policy across successive governments.

In the face of globalization, there is a palpable concern among many countries that the overwhelming dominance of Western influences in pop culture, such as the adoption of English over native languages and Western dress codes, might dilute traditional identity and values. These concerns are pronounced in countries like Malaysia and Thailand, where there is a strong push to preserve cultural heritage and promote traditional values through state policies and media. Governments actively combat perceived cultural erosion by reinforcing traditional customs and values through education, public campaigns, and legislative measures. In Indonesia, for instance, the promotion of Batik day, where citizens are encouraged to wear traditional attire, serves as a response to Western clothing trends, reinforcing a sense of national identity and cultural pride.

Shared cultural touchstones and pop culture in public schooling

In the modern era, it has become almost impossible to have any monocultural touchstones shared by Maldivians, since most people, especially young people, consume all their core stories and tropes and fundamental ideas about the world through globalized and international pop culture. Even in the present time, with discourse around revitalizing Maldivian identity, there are questions of clarity and intentionality in what such a policy would entail. An approach where people feel lectured or judged may even pushing people away, if not carefully designed to create a sense of identifying with Maldivian-ness or a sense of solidarity with other Maldivians. Making it about ethnicity or land or birth is insufficient, because feeling superiority about being from a country or having some citizenship is different from love for a country and solidarity with a nation you are part of. A collective focus with full clarity and intent to defining and establishing a clear national identity that resonates with people and that comes with a value system so that there is such a thing as “what it means to be Maldivian” – as long as the question of what makes you truly Maldivian, what it means to “be” Maldivian, is vague or just about circumstance of birth or something vaguely defined, it’s not going to last because it’s not anchored in anything solid. An anchor laid in soft sand isn’t keeping anything from drifting away.

As a thought experiment as you read this: what would people say is Maldivian identity? What would people say are universal Maldivian values? - Environmentalism? Love of the sea? Is there anything clear that isn’t either just circumstance of birth/ethnicity/history? - In art about the Maldives, is there reflection of what it’s like to be a modern Maldivian? Turtles, libaas, lacquerwork, coconuts, beaches, those are symbols but if all we have is symbols, what’s missing? What do people feel solidarity with other Maldivians as a collective about- since most of us aren’t wearing libaas or swimming with turtles in our daily lives - what makes us feel connection with others we don’t know? What binds us to every other Maldivian, if we have to put words to it?

Even just fifteen years ago, every Maldivian would have certain common cultural touchstones. For example, everyone knew the characters from Muhammad-Rasoolullah the TV show, since everyone watched the show every Ramadan. Now, most people choose what to watch from streaming media, and popular cultural touchstones which only air at a certain time are far more inaccessible than any materials on popular streaming channels like Netflix or YouTube. Identifying potential sites for creating monocultural touchstones and providing these common stories, characters, quotable lines and moments, memorable scenes and emotional storylines, and so on in a place where most Maldivians will be exposed to them is necessary to create touchstones shared by Maldivians.

In a world where there is no longer “mass media” that is collectively consumed by everyone and most people consume their own algorithmically curated choices across their own preferred streaming services based on globalized recommendations, the only remaining site to create monocultural touchstones in pop culture is probably the compulsory public school system. This means that the public school system now has a cultural weight that it has never before had, and that perpetuating cultural touchstones and commonly experienced pop culture – movies, shows, plays, etc… with beloved characters, quotable lines and line deliveries, touching and memorable scenes, emotional and tragic moments, iconic jokes, and so on – is now left up to the public school system, since almost no other consistent space remains for people to consume long-form content – no other options that everyone can be exposed to are any longer than 1 minute looped on a public transport screen or government service waiting room TV, 10 seconds on an outdoor billboard or office poster, etc.

Healthy conceptions of masculinity and preventing male radicalization

Disillusionment of young men leading to increasingly anti-social behaviour and radical political views is a problem identified across the world, with these young men often being drawn to nihilistic ideologies that blame women and society. This is also encouraged by social and material issues that prevent men from executing what they view as their masculine role as provider, for example through housing being unaffordable for most. Ignoring the need to channel young men’s disillusionment or insecurities about the opportunity to exercise their masculinity can lead to societal ills we increasingly see in other countries, so there is a need to proactively define and promote a healthier version of masculinity before globalized nihilistic strands take root. For example, this can emphasize that masculinity requires masculine values such as duty, protection, and honour. These traits are celebrated in national heroes or figures who have contributed to the country – not just heroes, but brave and honourable and hardworking everyman such as builders, writers, administrators and community leaders from the past - portrayed as embodying these traits.

Within the societal fabric, adherence to masculine virtues extends beyond individual actions to encompass social conduct. Currently, what many men seem to perceive as masculine or manly behaviour includes reckless or antisocial actions that may be “macho” but are neglectful of the social responsibility of men. Reckless public behaviour, such as speeding, can be framed as not only as a violation of traffic laws but also as a departure from the masculine expectation for responsibility and duty towards safeguarding the vulnerable. This expectation stems from a broader cultural understanding that men are entrusted with the role of protection and must refrain from actions that endanger others, particularly weaker members of society, such as children and the elderly. Such values find resonance in the teachings of the prophets, who emphasized the importance of compassion, humility, and protection of the vulnerable.

Similarly, behaviours like sexual harassment, workplace gender discrimination, or general disrespect towards women are condemned not only for their legal and ethical implications but also for their dishonourable nature. Drawing from historical and religious precedents, which emphasize the duty of men to stand up for and protect women, such actions are seen as a betrayal of masculine virtues and an act of bullying that undermines the fabric of societal honour and respect, reflecting the traditional place of honour that women had in Maldivian culture before men lost their sense of honour and chivalry.

The masculine virtues and values of heroes and honoured figures would also have a more prominent role to model the values inherent to a national identity. Beyond outward displays of strength and protection, the embodiment of masculine identity is deeply intertwined with notions of humility, integrity, and self-restraint. Rather than ostentatious displays of status or wealth, healthy and mature masculinity is emphasized as being reflected in modesty and a reluctance to boast or flaunt one's achievements. Rather than treating women dishonourably or neglecting and abandoning their children, the ideal for men is perceived as having the maturity and responsibility to do right by their families. This principle extends to acts of piety or benevolence, where the true measure of virtue lies not in public proclamation but in quiet, sincere deeds. In essence, the masculine ideal emphasizes integrity, not outward exhibitions of strength but also moral fortitude and a commitment to humility in both action and demeanour. This is actually in line with the traditional Maldivian understanding of the role of men (for example, even from our youth we might remember our grandparents telling us that men should be serious and proactively bear responsibility in any social setting). An emphasis on humility and integrity serves as a counterbalance to ego and vanity, reinforcing that honour is found not in public recognition or status games but in the quiet fulfilment of duty and responsibility towards others, particularly those in vulnerable positions. This reflects the teachings of Islamic prophets and the values deeply rooted in Maldivian culture and tradition.

Key roundtable discussion points

1\. East and Southeast Asian governments promote certain values or character traits and behaviour like etiquette and respect as part of national identity. In countries like Singapore starting with Lee Kuan Yew, China, Malaysia and Indonesia, South Korea, and others, pro-social values and etiquette are deeply ingrained as part of national identity

2\. Values that shape identity can include things like duty toward the community, social contract, protection of the vulnerable, considering personal and societal cost vs benefit of a choice, honour and dishonour, masculinity as about honour in protecting the vulnerable, restraint, humility/grace, charitable interpretations of others, appreciation and gratitude, a desire to not shame our ancestors, and so on.

3\. How these values can manifest in forms of etiquette like being orderly in queues or lines, waiting your turn, not littering, not spitting on the street, supporting public cleanliness, avoiding conspicuous consumption and displays of wealth, avoiding speeding or reckless driving, respecting the dignity of the dead, family duty, honouring secrets, avoiding gossip and speculation wherever possible, consideration for people in difficult circumstances such as the poor or mentally ill, defending and protecting the vulnerable in society such as women and children, not bullying, not abusing power in the workplace, treating employees with respect, polite/respectful treatment of migrants, respecting the elderly, giving up seats on public transport to pregnant or elderly, refusal to participate in dishonourable actions, commitment and work ethic in your job, etc.

4\. How these values and etiquette are ingrained into society through actions of the state and nation-building, especially in the decades after independence and decolonization. As nation-building, countries framed certain values and behaviour and etiquette as reflecting national identity. Examples can be found in Singapore, China, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, etc.

5\. How these promote a conception of national identity as coming with a certain set of values, etiquette, behaviour, and norms, with these values and behaviours being identified and drawn from or in relation to the country's history, culture, traditions, and religion.

6\. Taking note where relevant of countries where this kind of promotion of values and norms reference Islamic ideals of behaviour, but also looking at where other religious or spiritual traditions and ideals (whether Christianity, Buddhism, Shinto, Confucianism, etc) apply.

7\. Where and how this conception of values as part of national identity is framed as national exceptionalism, with citizens of this nation being seen as seeking to be exemplars of these moral behaviour and etiquette and social norms, so that those who don't follow these principles are seen as negative reflections on the country.

8\. Where history and the behaviour of the nation's people in the past as having had these etiquette and values as core traditional values is promoted, and current lack of etiquette and social norms is framed as either social deterioration, a failure of the nation to maintain the greatness of its past, or as corruption of the nation's values in how its citizens behave by external foreign influences.

9\. How the framing of this perceived degradation of moral character through values like respect for elders and women, protecting the vulnerable, humility, good manners, orderliness in public, duty toward the community, honour and honesty, etc... is paralleled as a diluting of national identity similar to examples of cultural dilution like young people not learning their native languages and using English instead, western dress instead of traditional, etc.

10\. Where states present this national identity with certain values and behaviour and etiquette as the true culture of the country, with current lack of etiquette and moral social norms being seen as corrupting influences that promote individualistic views and selfishness over traditional ideas of duty toward the community and respect toward others

11\. When and where national pride was invoked to promote these values and etiquette or behaviour, and where not following these values was framed as shameful or dishonourable. With patriotism invoked to argue that the country's residents should display moral values and etiquette on the world stage as how it's seen by outsiders, in ways from the impression that interactions with locals would have to tourists, to examples like how the cleanliness of public spaces in Singapore impresses visitors, how the orderliness of Japanese public transport or Japanese fans cleaning stadiums after World Cup games contributes to the positive image of said countries to the world, etc.

12\. Even specifically looking at examples related to perceived masculine values within this culture, with masculine values and virtues being seen as things like principles of duty toward the community, responsibility for the weak and vulnerable, honour, and other values, with a lack of these values being framed as men having abandoned the nature of being a man in the past during a time of greater national identity, and how national heroes of the past are held up as exemplifying these principles of masculine virtue. National heroes and iconic figures are often meant to not inspire just patriotism toward defending the country's greatness but also to serve as exemplars for what the model citizen would be like

13\. How these are applied in practice by governments as social engineering, from public awareness campaigns on good policy, to encouraging public shaming of etiquette violations, to framing certain behaviour as unattractive or unmasculine (similar to how the promotion of smoking as repulsive to women and unattractive contributed to the reduction of rates of smoking in men), to how much it gets emphasized in public education
