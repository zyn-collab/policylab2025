# A searchable knowledge repository for the social sector

## Replicated research and scattered documentation

Every new policy report, every consultant assessment, every strategic plan in the social sector begins with some version of the same background research. Consultants conduct stakeholder meetings to learn what programs exist and how they work. They search for previous reports and often cannot find them, or find some but miss others. They piece together the history and evolution of policies from scattered sources, institutional memory, and whatever documents happen to be accessible. This process is repeated for every new piece of work, because there is no central place where relevant research and documentation has been compiled — so the same background information is gathered again and again, the same stakeholders are interviewed about the same topics, and despite all this, the resulting reports often have gaps because older documents are simply not findable.

This is a structural gap in how knowledge is managed across the sector, not a failure of any particular ministry or consultant. Reports are published, circulated briefly, and then effectively disappear. They exist somewhere on a hard drive or in a filing cabinet, but they are not indexed, not searchable, and not accessible to the next person who needs them. Academic research on Maldivian social policy exists but is scattered across journals and repositories that practitioners rarely have time to search. International assessments and guidance documents from UN agencies and development partners are available online but not compiled in any sector-specific way. The collective knowledge that should be accumulating over time instead dissipates, and each new effort starts closer to zero than it should.

## Building the repository

Public Policy Lab has been working with the Ministry of Social and Family Development to build a centralized, searchable digital repository of all relevant documentation for the social sector — publications from government agencies, research from NGOs and civil society organizations, assessments and reports from international bodies, and academic literature on Maldivian social policy. Around 200 documents have been compiled and labelled so far, with a searchable portal built to make them accessible. The next phase involves incorporating the Ministry's own internal reports and research, adding detailed tagging by department and policy area, and taking the portal online for broader access.

Alongside the document repository, we are building a searchable archive of news coverage with sector-related keywords. This may seem like a minor addition, but news archives allow researchers to trace how specific policy areas or institutions have evolved over time through public reporting — major incidents and cases, patterns in the frequency of certain issues making headlines, the public reception of policy changes. For anyone trying to build a timeline of developments in a specific area, or to understand the context and history of a particular institution, searchable news archives provide a layer of information that formal reports often omit. This is especially valuable for onboarding new staff or consultants who need to quickly get up to speed on the background of an issue.

## From starting from scratch to building on what exists

The goal is to shift from a situation where every new piece of work starts from scratch to one where new work builds on what already exists. When a consultant is commissioned to assess a policy area, they should be able to search the repository and immediately find previous assessments, relevant academic research, international guidance, and internal ministry documents — all in one place, all searchable, all properly labelled. The hours currently spent hunting for documents or re-gathering background information can instead be spent on the actual analytical work. The gaps that currently exist because older documents were not findable can be closed.

Beyond the repository itself, we are producing literature reviews and policy timelines for key areas so that ready-made reference documents exist for the most common research needs. Rather than every new report having to piece together the history of a policy area from scattered sources, a single well-researched timeline can serve as the starting point. This is knowledge infrastructure — the kind of investment that does not produce visible outputs in the short term but that makes every subsequent piece of work faster, more comprehensive, and better grounded in what came before.
