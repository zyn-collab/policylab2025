The Maldivian economy has long been defined by its geography. Our reliance on imports for finished goods and spare parts creates a persistent state of dependency, characterized by high costs, long supply chains, and inherent vulnerabilities. This reality does more than affect prices; it acts as a "silent brake on innovation," as the capital required to establish even small-scale production is a barrier that few can overcome. To break this cycle, we will establish a national network of publicly accessible digital fabrication hubs. By providing public access to advanced manufacturing tools like 3D printers and CNC machines, we can democratize the means of production. In this context, the main opportunity lies not in making general consumer goods, but in producing and repairing critical spare parts for our own infrastructure and services, and in allowing local firms to prototype and test small runs of specialised items.

This approach has been identified elsewhere in islands with fragile supply chains and high import dependency. In Guam, the island is almost 100% reliant on imported goods, and supply chain disruptions highlighted the need for local manufacturing capacity. Industrial 3D printing in Guam has reduced requisition times for mission-critical parts by up to 90%, mitigating supply chain risks[^99]. This has been identified as a means for economic diversification[^100]. 3D printing enables on shore production, reduces lead times and transportation costs[^101], allows just in time inventory, and lowers per unit costs for small runs. In-house 3D printing capacity eliminates the need to import finished parts and therefore improves supply chain resilience[^102]. In particular, 3D printers and additive manufacturing is a powerful means of quick responses to natural disasters and increases resilience[^103]. 3D printing and additive manufacturing is currently used for areas ranging from major waste disposal in Samoa[^104], medical logistics in military operations[^105], apparatus for providing clean water[^106], humanitarian supplies in the field[^107], medical supplies and consumables[^108], environmental applications[^109], equipment or spare parts such as pipe fittings[^110], and spare parts of biomedical equipment and machines[^111]. Solar-powered 3D printing equipment has been identified as a means for relief in an island environment already within the Solomon Islands[^112].

The additive manufacturing literature emphasises that access to digital fabrication tools lowers barriers to entry for inventors[^113], small businesses and hobbyists. By providing shared access to 3D printers and CNC machines, makerspaces cultivate a “maker economy” and support STEM education. Global experiences from community fabrication labs show that subsidised access accelerates product development and local innovation[^114]. Many public makerspaces operate on a mixed use model, charging commercial users to subsidise community access. This practice is recommended by industry guides and has been adopted in several countries, lending credibility to the brief’s proposed financial structure. The initial focus can be on a small set of concrete use cases, establishing the model and adding economic value even while the public and businesses adapt to the availability of these services and build new products or services that take advantage of these workshops. Examples include replacement fittings and connectors for water and sewage systems, simple brackets and housings for public health equipment, and non-critical components for ferries and harbour infrastructure. In each case, the aim is to cut downtime, reduce dependence on long import chains for small parts and build a local habit of repair and adaptation.

A public utility for innovation

The proposal is to establish government-owned-and-operated hubs in Malé and key regional centres, conceived not as simple workshops but as public utilities for innovation. In the same way we provide access to water and electricity, we can provide access to the tools needed to turn a digital design into a physical object. The state’s role is to act as the enabler, managing core logistics and removing barriers by providing the tools, managing all maintenance and upgrades, securing raw materials in bulk, and offering technical expertise to help users.

The financial model is designed for long-term viability and public benefit. The hubs will lease machine time to larger companies at commercial rates, creating a revenue stream to fund operational costs. This commercial use as an economic engine allows the hubs to offer heavily subsidized access to small businesses, startups, artists, and students—a "social catalyst". An entrepreneur can affordably print a first batch of a product for market testing; a boat owner can print a replacement for a broken part instead of waiting weeks for an import. This unleashes latent creative and commercial potential. This initiative fosters a "maker economy," supports STEM education, enhances the resilience of countless sectors by enabling the rapid local production of spare parts, and gives rise to a dynamic, self-sufficient economic base built on the ingenuity of our own people.

This approach also has clear limits. Additive manufacturing and CNC equipment are capital-intensive and require a steady supply of skilled technicians and of imported feedstock. Without careful planning, machines can sit idle or be used mainly for one-off curiosities. For any part that is load-bearing, safety critical or used in regulated sectors such as aviation or medicine, we will need clear standards, certification rules and inspection. Mini-factories are a useful tool for resilience in niche areas and for learning. They are not a substitute for larger industrial supply chains, and they should be treated as such.
