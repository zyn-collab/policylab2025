For the Maldives, climate change has never been merely a component of foreign policy or a subsection of environmental management. It is the inescapable context for national survival and the primary driver of our grand strategy for the next two decades, framing our approach to everything from economic development and fiscal stability to our standing in the global order. However, a review of the last thirty years suggests that our international posture has not always reflected the desperation of that reality. We have often positioned ourselves as the "Gandhi of nations," attempting to appeal to the better nature of the international community through civility, moral persuasion, and performative "model citizen" behaviour. This approach, while dignified, has fundamentally failed to alter the trajectory of global emissions. The arithmetic of the crisis is brutal and unavoidable, and it dictates that we could shift from a posture of polite appeals to one of pragmatic, relentless, and transactional diplomatic leverage. This brief argues for an aggressive strategy based on a clear-eyed calculation of impact, where we stop trying to save the world through our own negligible emissions cuts and start using our diplomatic capital to force action from the major emitters who actually control the thermostat of the planet.

What do the numbers really tell us?

The Maldives’ total emissions constitute approximately 0.0058% of the world's CO2 emissions. To put this in perspective, our national output is roughly 0.018% of China's, 0.047% of the United States', 0.08% of the European Union's, and even just 0.69% of Poland's, a mid-sized industrial nation[^1]. These numbers lead to a stark conclusion: if the Maldives were to achieve complete carbon neutrality tomorrow, or even if the entire archipelago were to sink into the ocean and cease producing any emissions whatsoever, the impact on the global climate trajectory would be statistically non-existent.

This mathematical reality exposes a strategic incoherence in prioritizing domestic decarbonization as a method of climate mitigation. The argument that "every little bit counts" is a miscalculation of the urgency and timeline of the climate crisis. A single diplomatic breakthrough that compels or inspires a major industrial nation to reduce their emissions by a mere 0.01% would achieve double the impact on global CO2 output than if the Maldives eliminated its emissions entirely.

Therefore, we argue that a strategy centred on achieving our own carbon neutrality for the sake of mitigation is a misallocation of limited resources. While the Maldives was at the forefront of international leadership on reducing carbon emissions early on because it was viewed as a future existential crisis, treating it that way now — when we are in the throes of a present emergency — requires a different calculus. Continuing to act as if our own emissions are the problem lets the actual polluters off the hook. It allows wealthy nations and corporations, whose wealth was built on a century of high-emission development that is directly responsible for our current peril, to applaud our "moral leadership" while they continue to drag their feet.

Matching actions to the stakes

Given the existential stakes, there is a disconnect between our words and our actions. We have spent decades declaring climate change to be an existential threat, telling the world that we are on the front lines of a crisis that will erase our nation from the map. Our policy behaviour does not match the urgency of that claim. If we truly believed that our survival was at stake — if we genuinely internalized the reality that our homes, our culture, and our future are on the brink of annihilation — our national strategy would look radically different. It would be defined by a singular, desperate focus on survival. We could use this as an analogy: in a situation where you are told that unless you raise \$10,000 by the end of the week, you and your family will be killed. Faced with such a threat, your response would be total mobilization. You would sell every asset, call in every favour, and plead with every contact. If all you did was log some extra overtime, that would not make any sense as a response to those stakes or urgency or timeline. If you asked a coworker for help, claiming your life was in danger if you couldn’t put together enough money, but they could see that all you were doing was just taking more OT that week, they would not believe you. They would conclude that either you are lying about the threat or you do not understand its reality.

In framing climate policy around polite speeches, incremental domestic adjustments, and participation in standard international forums, we signal that we view climate change as just one serious problem among many, but not a fatal or particularly urgent one, regardless of whether we refer to it as urgent and existential in speeches. We act as if we have time. In negotiations where countries are balancing out their interests, there is little moral urgency or imperative to make any sacrifices of note or to engage on the issue in a significant way. This puts little pressure to make the hard, costly decisions that would actually save us. If we want the world to believe that we are fighting for our lives, we would need to start acting like it: to show that we are backed into a corner and willing to use every lever of influence, however unconventional, to ensure our survival. There is little to suggest that we are not willing to just go quietly while countries get to focus on their own geopolitical interests and domestic politics. Countries may feel compelled to take action where their actions are either actually particularly salient or where it could have any impact on their own interests, particularly in a way that could affect their internal politics. If we go extinct quietly, that’s convenient for the countries that could be doing something about it.

Allocating emissions-reduction spending to diplomacy

If our domestic emissions are irrelevant to the global equation, our power lies not in our virtue but in our leverage. Arguably, the most effective use of resources in a pure CO2-reduced-per-dollar-spent perspective for a country like the Maldives would be to reorient its foreign policy apparatus into a permanent engine of climate diplomacy. A small team within government – which we’ll call a Climate Diplomacy Unit working alongside the Foreign Ministry and Environment Ministry – staffed not by generalists but by experts in finance, industrial processes, and negotiation, dedicated to meticulously targeting and lobbying every persuadable city, corporation, or state government in the developed world. Looking at the real numbers, persuading even one mid-sized global city, a large multinational corporation, or a massive individual building complex in the developed world to aggressively decarbonize on an accelerated timeline would have more impact on carbon emissions than decarbonizing several atolls. One province in a major global economy building a single solar mega-farm or nuclear reactor achieves more for our survival than any decarbonization project within Maldivian borders realistically could.

The allocation of resources between trying to go carbon-neutral domestically and trying to mitigate future impacts through diplomacy could shift heavily toward the latter. Domestic decarbonization that doesn’t also have other benefits for economic security, energy independence, resilience, or climate mitigation is a waste of resources in terms of opportunity cost for intended outcomes, but policies such as mass rollout of solar power is still necessary for overall energy independence, security, resilience to increasingly frequent climate disasters, and a reduced need for massive and volatile dollar outflows on importing fossil fuels. Any notable reduction in carbon emissions can only happen through even marginal changes by actual significant emitters.

We should be okay with abandoning the moral high ground and polite diplomacy of the past. If moral leadership early on just led to the developed world dawdling, the moral imperative to prevent global catastrophe now justifies aggressively drawing attention to the issue and making honest, demanding arguments for climate justice. The point is not to give up our moral *claim* – we can strongly argue that our cause is morally righteous and even imperative. It is to use this moral claim in a more hard-headed way: to link our words more tightly to our diplomatic positions, our investment choices and our alliances.

Leapfrogging energy generation is non-negotiable

Countries that are currently poor will need to develop further. This will require massive use of electrification. There is no way around this point. While some circles of the West have conversations about degrowth or un-growth, this idea is a complete nonstarter when considering the actual scale of economic disparity between the global poor and the wealthy minority of countries. Slowing or pausing global economic growth is either asking billions around the world to continue to accept poor conditions and poverty while the wealthy few in advanced countries make a comparatively negligible sacrifice. Even if these un-growth or degrowth ideas were to commit to the idea of full redistribution – which will not happen, since it would require those in wealthy first-world countries to voluntarily give up most of their quality of life – the numbers and relative wealth would not make a life that most would aspire to be achievable for anyone.

With the nonstarter that no peoples, especially those already in poverty, rightly would not choose to delay their own growth in quality of life or industrialization by not allowing their citizens full access to electrification and industry, then this growth and industrialization has to be fuelled by carbon-neutral power sources. With non-renewable power sources, this will mean a massive further rise in emissions from these countries, even if first-world nations were to do their part and rapidly decarbonize on track. There is no path to avoid climate catastrophe without massive investment in carbon-free energy generation supplying developing nations through massive rollouts of solar, major hydroelectric projects, or massive nuclear power stations in areas where they can serve massive populations of people effectively.

We do already see that even regular market forces have already begun a process of leapfrogging in electrification, including several African countries over 2025 and Pakistan the year prior. Much like how many African countries leapfrogged directly to using wireless mobile phones entirely during a period of rapid progress without ever having had the intermediate step of mass landline phones, there is an opportunity for countries rapidly industrializing and scaling up electrification for development to do so with fuel sources that don’t contribute to global warming, whether this is renewables or nuclear energy. Near-vertical take-off lines in these graphs show explosive growth in solar panel rollout, with examples such as a 33-fold rise in solar panel imports from the prior 12 months in Algeria in 2025, 8x growth in Zambia, 7x in Botswana, and 3-6x in Sudan, Liberia, Congo, Benin, Angola and Ethiopia. In total, 25 African countries imported at least 100MW of solar panels in the 12 months leading up to June 2025. Solar panels imported into Sierra Leone in these 12 months would generate electricity equivalent to 61% of the entire country's 2023 electricity generation, sparking a massive increase in available electricity for residents[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]. Accelerating these trends to divert entire countries away from ever developing capital-intensive fossil fuel electrification, and the resulting distorted political economy incentives to maintain fossil fuel use, is necessary to avoid further runaway climate change.

Building a coalition of the desperate

As the climate crisis deepens, conventional diplomacy will likely prove insufficient. The Maldives could actively forge a formal alliance with other nations for whom climate change represents a near-term existential threat — low-lying Pacific states, vulnerable delta nations like Bangladesh, and other Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This "Coalition of the Desperate" would act not merely to negotiate but to make credible, unified demands and, where necessary, threats that shatter the complacency of global negotiations.

We are approaching a point where the polite fiction of "we are all in this together" is no longer sustainable. Nobody admits it openly yet, but we are nearing a moment where it becomes politically and morally unjustifiable for governments of climate-vulnerable nations, who have a duty toward their own citizens’ survival, not to consider emergency measures. These emergency measures cannot be left on the backburner and not alluded to until an emergency is at our doorstep. The drastic nature of these measures and the potential moral or national security necessity for these measures means that it makes sense to bring them up early as diplomatic levers. For example, the current global discourse on geoengineering (technologies such as solar radiation management or stratospheric aerosol injection)[^4] is dominated by the concerns of high-emitting nations in the Global North. They frame it as a dangerous and uncertain technology with possible unintended consequences, such as altering monsoon patterns or causing cold snaps in temperate zones. This framing conveniently ignores that their continued business-as-usual emissions constitute a far more dangerous and uncontrolled experiment with the global climate, one that guarantees the destruction of nations like ours.

Climate crises and national security

From a national security perspective, the need for sovereign actions that may go against the wishes of others can be justified in the face of a crisis. If a country like India or Bangladesh were about to be subject to a massive nuclear attack from another state that might kill hundreds of thousands of people, it would be expected that they would take whatever measures are needed to aggressively avert such a threat, even if that might mean attacking other countries from which these nuclear missiles were coming. In the case of an equivalent mass casualty event, would governments not have the same duty to their citizens to take whatever action might prevent such a catastrophe even if it might violate a treaty, and would they not face those domestic pressures from people who rightly expect their lives as citizens to be valued? Mass casualty events such as a heatwave with wet-bulb temperatures projected to kill hundreds of thousands of people — an event that the current pace of climate change makes increasingly inevitable — their governments may feel they have no choice but to deploy sulphur-based cloud seeding or other cooling measures, regardless of international conventions. The argument that such actions might cause unintended consequences like crop failures in North America becomes a hard sell when the alternative is immediate mass death in the Global South. To go back to the example of alternative causes for mass casualties, if a European country was responsible for casualties in six figures, would defensive measures that aren’t directly targeting but might have some spillover effects on other countries not be the clearly justified option compared to doing nothing and accepting mass death?

By pointing this out — and by forming contingency alliances to prepare for emergency geoengineering — the Maldives and its partners can validate the right of doomed nations to take defensive measures. This is not necessarily about deploying these technologies tomorrow, but about using the *credible threat* of unilateral or bloc-based geoengineering to force major emitters to the table. If the Global North fears the instability of geoengineering, they must pay the price to prevent it. That price is immediate, binding, and massive emissions reductions, coupled with tangible support for our survival.

Transactional demands and a Leapfrog Fund

If we use our diplomatic leverage effectively, we can move beyond vague promises of aid to specific, transactional demands. Fairness dictates that wealthy countries, cities, and companies that benefited from the past century of rapid growth through high-emission development — which is a direct cause-and-effect of our current crisis — should honour a social contract. They chose, decade after decade, a path to riches that meant bringing ruin to millions of people in small countries.

In exchange for climate stability and the forbearance of this Coalition of the Desperate, we could demand specific concessions that ensure our survival.

Global Leapfrog Fund: We could propose a massive, internationally funded initiative to rapidly deploy renewable energy and next-generation nuclear power across the developing world. The goal would be to allow industrializing nations to "leapfrog" the fossil fuel stage entirely as they industrialize, much as many African nations skipped landlines and went straight to mobile phones. There is evidence this is already beginning to happen due to market forces; solar panel imports in Africa have skyrocketed, with countries like Algeria seeing a 33-fold increase and Zambia an 8-fold increase in the 12 months leading to June 2025[^5]. A dedicated fund could accelerate this trend, preventing the lock-in of new carbon infrastructure in the Global South. In broad terms, this is already on the table – what we would need to demand is a massive scaling up of this program to meet the urgency of the moment[^6].

Land for Life: We should be willing to articulate the perverse geography of climate change. The same emissions rendering our islands uninhabitable are simultaneously thawing vast tracts of tundra in Canada, Russia, and the northern United States, creating new arable and habitable land. There is a direct causal link between the value being created there and the destruction happening here. We could argue for legally binding agreements that grant land allocation and citizenship rights to climate-displaced populations in these newly viable territories. This is not charity; it is a form of physical reparation for a loss that is their gain.

Debt relief and climate swaps: We could aggressively pursue debt-for-climate swaps, arguing that our external debt obligations should be written down in proportion to the climate damages we incur — damages caused by the very creditors to whom we owe money[^7].

The geopolitics of energy transition

This strategy does not exist in a vacuum; it must be executed within the defining geopolitical context of the next twenty years, which is the rivalry between the United States and China. An international coalition of major countries within the Global South can leverage this dynamic rather than being crushed by it.

China presents a complex duality: it is the world's largest current emitter, but also the unrivalled leader in the production of green technologies — solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries. Beijing also consistently positions itself diplomatically as a champion of the Global South. This creates a strategic opening. The Global Leapfrog Fund we propose is not only a climate necessity but economically advantageous for China, which would be the primary supplier of the hardware for this energy transition.

Mitigation is more impactful domestically than carbon-neutrality

Domestic projects which decarbonize being framed in any way as contributing to decarbonization or to averting climate change is just misleading. In terms of resource and impact, any decarbonisation in the Maldives affects a millionth of a percent of global emissions, having almost no direct impact on protecting Maldivians. Those same resources being used on mitigation which directly protects Maldivians is the clear way. There is still need for rollout of non-emitting energy sources for other reasons such as resilience against crises or supply chain disruptions, energy independence, fiscal health and decreased need for dollar outflows spending on oil, less local pollution, etc. Transitioning to solar power is vital because it reduces our reliance on imported fuel, protecting the economy from oil price shocks and improving our balance of payments. Increasing the use of renewables reduces local pollution and lowers the cost of living. Some might say that decarbonising and trying to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world is setting an inspiring example, but we have seen enough reason to believe that inspiration and appeals to conscience alone do not work to change the behaviour of major countries at scale, and just the nice label of being a carbon-neutral country is vanity if it’s not directly addressing our survival.

Mitigation efforts should be 100% focused on adaptation and survival. This means hardening critical infrastructure, investing in coastal protection (including exploring "soft" geoengineering like artificial reefs), ensuring freshwater security through resilient desalination and rainwater harvesting, and developing robust early-warning systems. We could expand the urban cooling and shading strategies proposed for Malé to all inhabited islands, using geographic mapping to identify heat-vulnerable areas and deploying natural canopy and engineered shade to reduce heat stress. These investments demonstrate a credible commitment to our own survival. They signal to the world that we are preparing for the long emergency, strengthening our moral authority when we demand that others do their part to prevent the worst-case scenarios.

In summary

The time for being the "Gandhi of nations" has passed. If we are in the throes of a climate emergency, our foreign policy must reflect that crisis mode. We cannot continue to prioritize polite diplomacy and domestic virtue-signalling while the root cause of our destruction remains unaddressed by those responsible.

By shifting our focus to aggressive climate diplomacy, building a coalition willing to put radical options like geoengineering on the table, and leveraging geopolitical rivalries to secure tangible survival guarantees, we move from a stance of pleading to one of power. This is a strategy that accepts the world as it is — transactional, power-driven, and dangerous — and uses every available tool to ensure that there is still a Maldives in 2045.
