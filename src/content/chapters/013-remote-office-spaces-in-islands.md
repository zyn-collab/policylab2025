<th><p>Historical Context and Policy Evolution</p>
<p>Governance and economic activity in the Maldives have historically been characterized by extreme centralization in Malé, driving a persistent wave of internal migration. This trend has depopulated smaller islands while causing severe congestion in the capital, where nearly 40% of the national population resided by 2022. Early policy responses, such as the "Population and Development Consolidation Policy" of the 2000s, essentially accepted this drift, encouraging migration to larger regional hubs to achieve economies of scale in service delivery and infrastructure provision.</p>
<p>The policy trajectory shifted significantly with the democratization process beginning in 2008. The Decentralization Act of 2010 and its substantial amendments in 2019 sought to reverse centralization by empowering local councils with fiscal autonomy and administrative authority. The 2019 amendments allocated a percentage of state revenue directly to councils and allowed them to retain income from local assets, aiming to create economic anchors in the atolls. Despite these legislative advances, the labor market remains heavily skewed. Private sector job creation in the atolls has lagged, leaving the civil service and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) as the primary employers in island communities.</p>
<p>This reliance on the public sector has resulted in a disproportionately large public payroll in the atolls, where jobs are often created to provide social stability rather than operational necessity. Data from 2014 indicated significantly higher unemployment rates in the atolls compared to Malé, highlighting a "missing middle" of productive private employment. Previous strategies relied on the physical relocation of people to jobs; the concept of remote office spaces represents a reversal of this logic, leveraging the newly established digital infrastructure to move jobs to the people. This aligned with the "Jazeera Raajje" (Island Nation) policy framework, emphasizing equitable island development and reducing the pressure for migration to the capital.</p></th>

For decades, the economic geography of the Maldives has been defined by an extreme concentration of formal employment in the Greater Malé Region. This centralization isn't merely a statistic; it's a physical force that hollows out island communities. Talented young people, faced with a lack of professional opportunities at home, are forced to migrate to the capital, leaving behind aging populations and shrinking local economies. This migration drives the housing crisis in Malé, where rent consumes the majority of a worker's income, while simultaneously depriving the atolls of the very human capital needed to spark organic development. It's a feedback loop that reinforces itself with each generation.

The traditional government response to this disparity has been to act as an employer of last resort. To support communities that lack economic drivers, the state creates public sector jobs in island councils and SOEs to absorb local labour. This approach is fiscally unsustainable and economically limiting[^87]. It traps talented individuals in low-productivity roles rather than connecting them to the dynamic private sector. It creates a dependency on the state budget that swells with every election cycle, as political pressure mounts to provide jobs in areas where the private market is absent. This results in a bloated public payroll and a private sector in Malé that struggles to find affordable talent – a lose-lose equilibrium where the state pays to keep people underemployed while businesses struggle to meet skill gaps in a low-efficiency matching system and geographical mismatches between productive private sector firms and a lot of local talent remaining in the islands.

Recent labour force data underscores the scale of this inefficiency. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), unemployment rates in the atolls are consistently higher than in the capital, with a significant portion of the population falling into the "potential labour force" – individuals available for work but not actively seeking it because there's nothing to seek. The World Bank has also highlighted the disparity in economic opportunities between Malé and the atolls as a key driver of inequality and internal migration[^88], with employment rates among new labour-force entrants in the atolls being 17 percentage points lower than in Male’[^89]. This structural imbalance forces the government to bear an increasing fiscal burden to maintain employment levels in the regions, diverting resources from critical infrastructure and social services that might actually help break the cycle.

The structural barrier that necessitated this migration – the physical need to be in an office in Malé to do "office work" – has largely evaporated. The digital infrastructure of the Maldives is now robust, with Dhiraagu having completed its fiber-to-the-home network across every inhabited island, giving the Maldives 100% coverage of high-speed fiber broadband[^90]. The missing link is no longer technological but organizational. We lack the professional interface that allows a company in Malé to confidently hire a team in Haa Dhaalu or Laamu without the friction and risk of managing isolated work-from-home arrangements. This is the gap which this proposal aims to address.

Remote offices in islands

To bridge this organizational gap, we're proposing the creation of a network of remote offices in islands (which we will refer to as IROs throughout this section for ease – we aren’t suggesting this exact terminology as a name). These are very different from casual co-working cafes or community centres that might occasionally be used for work. An IRO is a professionally managed, secure, and disciplined workspace designed to function as a satellite wing of major companies. An IRO would be a dedicated facility equipped with enterprise-grade internet, backup power, secure access control, and office-standard workstations. It would include essential office infrastructure that's often too expensive for an individual remote worker to maintain at home: high-speed printers, scanners, photocopiers, and video conferencing pods.

Each IRO would be staffed by an Office Manager and security personnel. The role of the Office Manager is the keystone of this model – they act as the on-ground proxy for the employer. Their responsibilities would include:

- **Supervision:** Ensuring staff clock in and out on time, maintaining attendance logs that are shared with the employer.

- **Discipline:** Maintaining a professional office environment, ensuring data privacy protocols are followed, and managing the physical security of the workspace.

- **Troubleshooting:** Handling internet outages, hardware malfunctions, or facility issues so that the remote employee does not have to also resolve technical problems without focusing on their work, and so that employers have a guarantee that technical issues won’t limit their ability to work seamlessly with remote teams.

This structure offers something valuable to both sides. For the employee, it provides the flexibility of living in their home island while maintaining the professional separation of work and home life[^91]. For the employer in Malé, it removes the primary risks of remote hiring. They're not hiring a freelancer working from a bedroom with unreliable wi-fi; they're hiring a full-time employee who reports to a secure, managed office every morning. This shifts the paradigm from "outsourcing" to "distributing" operations. A bank, an insurance firm, or a tech company could establish a customer support office in Eydhafushi or a data processing team in Gamu, seamlessly integrated into their daily workflow via the IRO infrastructure.

Design also matters for inclusion. Remote offices should be physically accessible to people with disabilities, and their programming should deliberately support women and young people who may not be able to migrate to Malé. That can mean setting opening hours and childcare arrangements in ways that make it realistic for carers to use the space, and working with employers to structure remote roles that are compatible with these realities. Currently, economic opportunities often implicitly exclude people with caregiving responsibilities or mobility constraints. Any new employment program needs to think about accessibility from the start rather than as an afterthought.

Past efforts in many countries to create rural telecenters and community IT hubs show both the promise and the pitfalls of this model. Where these centers were set up mainly as access points to computers or the internet, without clear links to real jobs or services, many ended up under-used or serving a narrow group of better-off young men. The Island Remote Office model needs to start from that experience. It should be anchored in specific job roles and service functions that are already in demand, not built on the hope that desks and Wi-Fi will somehow attract activity on their own.

Turning dead capital into active assets

One of the primary advantages of this strategy is its speed and relatively low capital intensity. Unlike major infrastructure projects that require land reclamation, heavy construction, and foreign loans, the IRO network can utilize "dead capital" – the vacant or underused buildings that already exist on almost every island[^92]. These might be under-utilized community halls, vacant government properties, or private commercial spaces that have sat empty due to lack of demand. Retrofitting such a space is a matter of days or weeks, not months or years. The investment required is primarily in fit-out: cabling, air conditioning, lighting, and furniture. This allows the program to be rolled out rapidly across multiple atolls, creating immediate economic impact. Case studies of co-working spaces have shown that retrofitting unused buildings can quickly create employment hubs while revitalizing demand for local spaces and boosting nearby businesses[^93]<sup>,</sup>[^94].

Because the capital costs are low, the IRO can potentially operate on a revenue-neutral or even profitable basis with relatively modest occupancy. The operational costs – electricity, internet, and the salaries of the manager and security guard – could be covered by the monthly "seat fees" paid by the private companies utilizing the space. This makes the model fiscally responsible; it's a catalytic investment by the government to set up the network, but the ongoing operation gets funded by the private sector value it creates. It transforms a liability (an empty building) into an asset (a hub of employment) without creating a permanent burden on the recurrent budget. That said, in practice, we'll need to watch the numbers carefully in the pilot phase to make sure the revenue model actually works as theorized.

The economic logic for businesses

Why would a Malé-based company choose to hire through an IRO? The business case is rooted in hard cost savings and labour arbitrage. Commercial real estate in Malé is prohibitively expensive, often serving as a cap on growth for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Expanding a team by ten people in the capital requires renting a larger office, which often involves a significant jump in fixed costs, long leases, and expensive fit-outs. In contrast, a company can rent ten desks in an IRO in Thinadhoo for a fraction of the cost – paying only for the seats they use, with no upfront capital expenditure and no long-term lease lock-in. The flexibility is enormous. If the business contracts, they can scale down their IRO footprint immediately without breaking a lease or subletting space. If they expand, they can add more seats without the logistical nightmare of office hunting in Malé.

A "living wage" in Malé is heavily distorted by rent[^95]. Salaries in the atolls are generally lower than in Malé, not because people in the atolls are less skilled, but because the cost of living (particularly housing) is significantly lower and the local labour market is thinner. From the perspective of a business, a customer service representative or data entry clerk who would need MVR 12,000 a month in Malé to cover rent and expenses might be willing to work for MVR 8000-9000 in their home island, where their family already owns a house and living costs are more manageable. Although the baseline salary disparity is unequal at face value, the overall take-home pay after cost of living differences balance out for local residents, and from a fairness perspective it isn’t providing an unfair advantage to either side when islands are already struggling for enough economic opportunities and providing market incentives to hire within islands is just correcting for the current status quo of business development being over-focused in Male’. This wage differential reflects differences in living costs rather than exploitation, and can create a win-win where the business saves money while the employee earns a competitive wage for their local context and gets to live close to home. This arbitrage allows companies to expand their workforce cost-effectively while offering wages that are highly competitive for the local market. A business could scale its operations faster, with lower risk, by tapping into a talent pool that is currently underutilized.

| Cost Factor | Malé Expansion | Island Remote Office (IRO) |
|----|----|----|
| Office Rent | High (approx. MVR 350–500/sqft) | Low (seat fee approx. MVR 1,500–2,000/mo) |
| Staff Salary (Living Wage) | High (driven by rent) | Moderate (high local purchasing power) |
| Recruitment | Competitive/high turnover | High loyalty/untapped pool |
| Overheads (Utility/Ops) | Direct cost to company | Shared/Included in seat fee |
| Flexibility | Low (Long leases) | High (Per-seat, per-month) |

Solving the skills mismatch and unlocking latent talent

This model directly addresses the skills mismatch frequently cited by employers. Islands will have many educated young people who have completed their A-levels or degrees but remain unemployed because they cannot afford to move to Malé or choose not to leave their families. For rural women, in particular, this model can be transformative. Domestic responsibilities for women with families can make migrating to Malé difficult. A talented woman in an atoll might be unable to move to the capital for a job, but she could easily commute to an office five minutes from her home. By providing a formal workspace, we also destigmatize remote work, framing it not as a casual side-gig but as a respectable career path that takes place in a professional environment. This unlocks a massive cohort of hidden talent that is currently excluded from the economy. Research on remote work emphasises that flexible work arrangements improve women’s labour force participation by accommodating caregiving responsibilities[^96]. This principle is widely supported in labour economics literature; digital platforms enabling remote work have been shown to open opportunities for women who cannot relocate to urban centres.

To ensure this talent connects with opportunity, the government’s role would extend beyond infrastructure to active intermediation. A strengthened "National Job Centre" could function as a specialized recruitment agency for IROs. Instead of a passive job board, case workers would actively maintain a database of island-based candidates, vetting their skills and matching them with Malé-based employers. They would facilitate the interviews and support the onboarding process, reducing the friction for companies trying this model for the first time.

The government as a first mover

For this model to succeed, we need to create demand before supply becomes self-sustaining. The state can play a catalytic role here by acting as the first major employer to adopt IROs at scale. The government has a powerful fiscal incentive to increase more productive public sector hiring within islands. Currently, the pressure to provide employment in the atolls often results in the creation of redundant public sector jobs, particularly when electoral pressures result in governments doing what can be done to provide jobs and incomes around elections regardless of the need for these roles — hiring an extra administrative officer in a council or a utility company simply because there are no other options for a local graduate. Adding these electoral-pressure public sector jobs add to the permanent recurrent expenditure of the state without increasing productivity. By facilitating the creation of private sector jobs through IROs, the government can reduce this pressure. Every job created by a private company in an IRO is a job the government does not have to create artificially. This allows the state to gradually rationalize the public sector payroll in the atolls, shifting resources from salary payments to investment in services and infrastructure.

By committing to place, say, 500 government jobs into IROs across ten islands within the first two years, the state creates a guaranteed revenue stream that de-risks the initial investment. This allows us to build and test the infrastructure, train the Office Managers, and iron out the operational kinks. Once the IRO network is demonstrably functional and the government is visibly benefiting from the cost savings and improved service delivery, private sector adoption becomes much easier. Companies can see the model working rather than being asked to take a leap of faith.

There is no operational reason why many government functions must be physically located in the most expensive square mile of real estate in the country. Ministries and agencies could establish their own distributed teams within these IROs. By moving these units to IROs, the government achieves three goals simultaneously. It lowers its own operating costs by reducing the need for expensive office space in Malé[^97]; demonstrates confidence in the IRO model to the private sector, showing that sensitive work can be done securely and efficiently from the atolls; and brings stable, dignified civil service jobs to the atolls, fulfilling the promise of decentralization not just in rhetoric but in payroll. There are many government functions that are currently performed in Malé but could be done remotely with zero loss of quality:

- **Citizen service hotlines:** Call centres handling inquiries about government services, benefits, and permits.

- **Data processing:** Digitization of records, data entry from forms, and processing of routine applications.

- **Translation and documentation:** Many government documents need translation between Dhivehi and English; this work is location-independent.

- **Monitoring and compliance:** Review of submitted reports, compliance checks for licensing, and routine audits that don't require field visits.

Governance and performance

Each Island Remote Office should have a clear owner and a simple performance framework. One option is for a national entity such as the Business Centre Corporation to hold and manage the physical assets, while island and city councils provide local coordination and help identify employers. Managers of these spaces should be hired through open competition with transparent criteria, not as political appointments.

The performance expectations for each IRO should be easy to understand and easy to measure. They might include average occupancy over the year, the number of jobs based in the office, the number of residents placed into remote roles with Malé-based or foreign firms, and user satisfaction. Spaces that consistently underperform should either be re-purposed to other uses that serve the community or closed and their resources consolidated elsewhere. In other words, we should be willing to experiment and to admit when a particular location does not work as intended.

A virtual headquarters for entrepreneurs

The flow of opportunity enabled by IROs is not unidirectional. The network also serves as a powerful tool for entrepreneurs, both in the islands and in Malé. For an entrepreneur in a small island who wants to start a business, the local labour pool is a constraint. They might have a great business idea but lack a local accountant or a graphic designer. Through the IRO network, they could hire staff located in a different atoll or even in Malé, managing them through the virtual office infrastructure. This allows island-based businesses to access the national talent pool, removing a key barrier to growth.

Similarly, for the thousands of micro-entrepreneurs in Malé — architects, designers, consultants — who currently operate out of cramped apartments because they cannot afford commercial office space, the IRO offers a solution. They could hire staff based in the atolls to handle administrative or support tasks. These staff would work from the IRO, giving the micro-enterprise a "virtual headquarters" and a professional workforce without the crushing overhead of a Malé office. This lowers the barrier to entry for new businesses, fostering a more dynamic and inclusive startup ecosystem where geography is no longer a destiny.

Risk mitigation and what could go wrong

We should be clear-eyed about the risks and failure modes of this model, because there are several ways it could go wrong if not implemented carefully.

**Empty shells:** The biggest risk is that we build the IROs but fail to route sufficient jobs through them. If occupancy stays low (under 30-40%), the model collapses. The fixed costs of the Office Manager and facility maintenance become unsustainable, and the IRO turns into another underutilized government building. The mitigation is the anchor tenant strategy – ensuring the government commits enough jobs upfront to achieve baseline occupancy, which then attracts private sector interest.

**Connectivity failures:** If the internet is unreliable or power outages are frequent, the entire value proposition evaporates. Employers will not tolerate their remote teams being offline regularly. This is why the infrastructure standards in the SOP are non-negotiable, including backup power and secondary internet connections. We'll need to be rigorous about this from day one, because a reputation for unreliability will kill the program faster than anything else.

**Cultural and social friction:** Introducing a new model of work can create tensions. In some islands, there may be scepticism about whether this remote work is "real work. This isn't universal, but real in some communities. The mitigation here is stakeholder engagement and the Community Liaison role – working with island councils and community leaders early to explain the model, address concerns, and ensure the IRO fits within local norms.

**Capacity to manage:** The Office Manager role is critical but also demanding. They need to balance being supportive to employees with being accountable to employers, handle technical issues they may not have trained for, and maintain professional standards in a context where "office culture" may be unfamiliar. We'll need to invest in proper training and ongoing support for Office Managers, and we can't just assume anyone with a management title can do this job effectively.

**Sustaining momentum beyond initial enthusiasm:** Many well-intentioned government programs start strong but fade as political attention moves elsewhere or as budgets get squeezed. The challenge is ensuring enough sustained commitment – both financial and political – through the first three to five years to reach the point where the program becomes self-sustaining through private sector adoption. This is partly about locking in institutional support across agencies (not just relying on one champion minister) and partly about building in accountability mechanisms that make it harder to quietly defund or neglect the program during lean years.

Next steps and pilot approach

Given these uncertainties, we'd recommend starting with a pilot phase rather than a full national rollout. Select three to five islands with different profiles (different sizes, different existing economic bases, different distances from Malé) and establish IROs there first. Run them for 18-24 months with rigorous monitoring of occupancy rates, employer satisfaction, employee retention, and community feedback. Use this learning period to refine the model, update the SOPs based on what actually works, and build the case for expansion with real data rather than projections. The pilot phase also gives us time to work through the legal and regulatory frameworks, train the first cohort of Office Managers (who can then become trainers for subsequent cohorts), and build relationships with early-adopter private sector employers. By the time we're ready for broader rollout, we'll have proven examples to point to rather than asking islands and businesses to take it on faith.

We think this model has real potential to change the economic geography of the Maldives in meaningful ways, but we're also aware that the devil is in the implementation details. The goal with this brief is to lay out the logic and the framework clearly enough that policymakers can make an informed decision about whether to pursue it, while being realistic about the work involved in making it succeed. If this program ends up being successful, it can be a means to reconnect the economic fabric of the Maldives[^98]. It rejects the binary choice between "development in Malé" and "stagnation in the atolls." By building a bridge of professional infrastructure, we can allow capital and work to flow to where people live, rather than forcing people to move to where the capital is. This is a vision of development that respects the dignity of island life while harnessing the efficiency of the modern economy, building a nation that is not just interconnected, but truly integrated.
