<th><p>Historical Context and Policy Evolution</p>
<p>Housing in the Maldives has evolved from a private, family-managed affair into the state's most pressing political and social challenge. Until the 1990s, housing was largely unregulated, with families building incrementally on inherited land. The explosion of Malé’s population—which doubled between 1985 and 2000—created a crisis of scarcity that forced the government to intervene. The initial major response was the reclamation of Hulhumalé in 1997, a massive state-led engineering project designed to create a new urban landmass to decongest the capital.</p>
<p>Since 2010, housing policy has been defined by aggressive, debt-financed public construction. The "Hiyaa" project, launched in 2016, introduced high-rise social housing on an unprecedented scale, constructing 7,000 units in Hulhumalé Phase II funded by Chinese loans. This was followed by the "Vinares" project and other government schemes. Despite this massive increase in supply, affordability and allocation remain critical failures. The 2014 census revealed severe overcrowding, with nearly 20% of households in Malé hosting multi-generational families in cramped conditions. Rents in the private market continue to absorb a debilitating percentage of household income, driven by the ceaseless migration to the capital.</p>
<p>Policy has oscillated between providing social housing units and allocating raw land. The "Gedhoruveriya" scheme introduced in 2022 marked a return to issuing land plots to Malé residents, a policy popular with voters but questioned by planners for its land-use efficiency compared to vertical development. The sector is characterized by the heavy involvement of the Housing Development Corporation (HDC), a state-owned entity that manages the reclaimed cities. The cumulative result of decades of policy is a landscape where the state is the primary developer, yet the demand for dignified, affordable living space continues to outstrip the delivery of units, necessitating a rethink of allocation mechanisms.</p></th>

The housing theory of everything

Housing is not merely one sector among many in the national portfolio; it is the physical container of society itself. It is the stage upon which the drama of national life—birth, childhood, marriage, sickness, and aging—is enacted. In policy circles, the "housing theory of everything" posits that a chronic shortage of affordable living space is the upstream cause of a vast array of downstream social and economic pathologies that policymakers often treat as separate, unrelated crises[^115]. We argue that the Maldivian government cannot effectively solve its fertility crisis, its public health burdens, its educational deficits, or its rising crime rates without first solving the fundamental scarcity of floor space. The connection between the roof over one’s head and the quality of life underneath it is absolute. When housing is scarce, it becomes expensive. When it becomes expensive, it absorbs the disposable income and mental bandwidth of the population, crowding out other essential investments in life, health, and family.

But the impact goes beyond the financial; it is biological, psychological, and sociological. For example, the housing crisis is a primary driver of low fertility rates, with housing affordability and availability identified as one of the main reasons for young families choosing to not have children[^116]. 55.5 per cent of the women surveyed expressed a desire for larger families, only to be thwarted by the reality of inadequate living space[^117]. This is also supported by international research: in one study, rising housing prices were responsible for 51% of the fall in birth rates in the United States[^118]<sup>,</sup>[^119]. In a densely populated island nation where land is a premium, the escalating costs and limited availability of suitable housing have become a formidable barrier to expanding families. Family formation is spatially constrained. In the Maldives, young people delay marriage not purely out of cultural shifts, but because the physical logistics of bringing a spouse into an already overcrowded parental home are undignified and stressful. The traditional trajectory of adulthood—getting a job, finding a home, starting a family—has been severed at the second step. Data indicates that couples are increasingly delaying childbearing or stopping at one child because they cannot visualize where a second crib would fit. When a potential parent looks at their living situation and sees only cramped rooms and exorbitant rents, the rational choice is to postpone having children, often until it is biologically too late for large families.

The connection between housing and health is clear. Overcrowding is a primary vector for communicable diseases; when fifteen people share a three-room apartment, a flu virus or a skin condition sweeps through the household with inevitable efficiency. With Male’ itself having one of the highest population densities in the world, this spread then rips through the entire city. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this vulnerability was exposed as a national security threat, but it remains a daily reality for respiratory illnesses and other contagions. These also have impacts beyond just the risk of contagious disease spread. The lack of privacy and the constant navigation of shared space create a high-cortisol environment, with this chronic stress exacerbates non-communicable conditions like hypertension and heart disease, burdening the Aasandha health insurance scheme with preventable costs. Mental wellbeing deteriorates in these conditions; the absence of a place to be alone, to decompress, or to have a private conversation is a direct assault on individual dignity[^120]. Any more than 2 people per bedroom has been associated with increased stress, relationship degradation, sleep disruption, and higher risk of disease[^121]<sup>,</sup>[^122].

For adolescents, the lack of privacy can lead to anxiety and behavioural issues, creating a generational mental health deficit. In the sphere of education, housing inequality manifests as an achievement gap that schools cannot close. A child who has a quiet, private desk and a consistent sleep schedule has a structural advantage over a child who studies on a bed shared with siblings in a room where the television is on and adults are conversing. We invest millions in tablets, curriculum reform, and teacher training, but we often ignore the fact that for many students, the home environment is actively hostile to deep work and concentration. The "homework gap" is really a housing gap. If we want a knowledge economy, we need to provide the physical environment where knowledge can be acquired. Perhaps most visibly, the housing crisis fuels the breakdown of law and order. When the home is a place of stress and crowding, life spills out onto the street. For at-risk youth, this physical displacement creates the availability and social friction that gangs exploit for recruitment of youth. A young man who has no dignity or autonomy at home will seek it elsewhere, often falling into street crime. Secure, decent housing is the bedrock of stability. Without it, our crime prevention strategies are fighting a losing battle against the environment in which people live. We are essentially pushing youth out of their homes and into the hands of criminal networks by failing to provide adequate living spaces.

In addition to this first-order effect relationship between crime and housing, the impact of housing on family breakdown is also a secondary contributor, and the challenges in housing conditions is identified by policymakers in interviews as a significant contributor to marital conflict and breakdown. Married couples living in overcrowded conditions often with their parents and their children, barely having any privacy in which to spend time with each other in ways that sustain their personal relationship and mutual affections, are likelier to have their marriages fall apart. In police records, every youth arrested for crimes has had divorced or broken families as a precursor that drove them into the lifestyle. High rates of suicidality among youth have also been identified by police as an epidemic. For all these social tragedies of drug addiction, crime, mental health challenges, suicidal ideation, and many other behavioural and educational problems, the challenges of housing can be identified as a major root cause.

The allocation problem: Why building supply is the only exit

To understand why the current approach has stalled, we must strip away the financial abstractions and look at the physical reality. The economy is not made of money; it is made of real resources. In the housing market, the fundamental unit is the physical home—effectively, a "concrete block". Imagine a simplified model where we de-abstract the idea of housing and describe homes as the material object: if there are 50,000 concrete blocks available in the city, but there are 60,000 potential households that need a place to live. (By potential households, we mean the number of households that would exist if supply were a non-constraint, which would be different than the actual number of extant households since currently many of those potential households cluster together into households which are much more crowded than all its constituent members would prefer). This is a physical deficit of 10,000 units. No amount of rent control, housing subsidy, eligibility criteria, or lottery mechanism can change this physical fact. 10,000 households will go without. All that a policy can do is shift *which* households will be excluded and how.

In a very simple model of a purely private market constrained by this scarcity, these blocks are allocated by price, and the 10,000 households with the highest relative ability and willingness to pay get a concrete block. (As mentioned earlier, there will composition effects of households in the face of this reality– eventually, parts of those 60,000 households that have less individual ability to pay will cluster together into actual households made up of multiple potential-households who combine their spending power to afford a home). This leaves the lower-income segments of the population homeless or crowded into substandard spaces. This is the "market solution," and it has created an untenable social context because it prioritizes financial capital over human need.

But without increased housing supply, the allocation problem still exists. If there’s 60,000 potential households that would like a “concrete block” or a home of their own and only 50,000 of those physical homes, there will still be 10,000 potential households who can’t find a home they would like. If the only policy intervention were rent controls without adding supply, the scarcity remains. The price drops, meaning all 60,000 potential households including the leftover 10,000 can now theoretically "afford" the rent. But there are still only 50,000 blocks. The allocation mechanism simply shifts from "who can pay the most" to "who the landlord prefers." This is particularly relevant since this lower rent will also increase the number of potential households, as many people who couldn’t afford to live separately would now be competing for those more affordable units as their own individual applicants. Pushing rents low enough to be affordable without adding supply will create induced demand. If rents suddenly became affordable in Malé, thousands of young people currently living with parents would rightfully seek to move out. They would enter the market, competing with poor families for the same limited pool of units. This intensifies the competition. Rent controls can reduce the financial burden on the lucky few who already have a lease, but they cannot solve the underlying unavailability of housing for the many. Faced with a surplus of applicants for a rent-capped unit, landlords will still have to choose, just along other factors. For example, a single tenant or young couple secure government jobs over a large family with more precarious income and multiple small children who might make noise or draw on the walls. In this way, the most vulnerable potential households are still those that are likeliest to get excluded. The vulnerable family, the single parent, and the young person with an irregular income are still excluded—not by price, but by risk selection. In a market defined by desperate shortage, price controls can also create a shadow economy of under-the-table payments and informal, handshake agreements that strip tenants of legal protection. This same issue of insufficient supply of actual physical housing units to meet the full demand of potential households will exist no matter what allocation mechanism is used: whether it’s free market prices, rent controls, score-based lists, lotteries, or any other possible means of allocation.

The only way to solve the allocation problem is to change the numbers. We would need to build enough concrete blocks so that the supply matches or exceeds the number of households. When there are 65,000 homes for 60,000 potential households, the power dynamic inverts. Landlords now have to compete for tenants. Subsequently, they will have to lower prices, guarantee safe conditions and regular maintenance, and improve quality to attract residents. This shifts the entire structural reality of the market. This means that objective of national housing policy cannot be merely to regulate the existing stock; it must be to flood the market with new stock until the scarcity premium evaporates[^123].

The current state of the Maldivian housing market

The Maldivian context, particularly in the Greater Malé Region, is an extreme example of this scarcity trap. Decades of centralized development policy—accelerated by the "population consolidation" philosophies of the 1990s and 2000s—have pulled the population toward the capital, creating one of the most densely populated urban footprints on Earth. Malé City proper houses over 211,000 people in just 8.3 square kilometres. This is not merely "urban density" in the Singaporean or Manhattan sense, which is planned and vertical; this is congestive density, where infrastructure is overwhelmed by sheer headcount. Data from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (2019) and subsequent rental indices paint a stark picture of the financial violence this scarcity inflicts. For the median household in Malé, rent consumes an exorbitant share of monthly income, often exceeding 50% or even 60%. In 50% of renting households, the cost of shelter consumes more than 30% of income—the international definition of "rent stress." But in the Maldivian context, the reality is often far grimmer: single incomes are entirely devoured by rent, requiring multi-income households just to secure basic shelter. This is exacerbated by how the disparity in essential services, education, and economic opportunities drives a steady flow of internal migration from the atolls to the capital region. This influx has overwhelmed the housing stock, leading to the proliferation of unsafe housing conditions as well as the normalization of illegal sub-letting of social housing, where beneficiaries of state support monetize their asset to survive, while the intended recipients are pushed further down the ladder.

Over 40% of households in the Greater Malé region endure overcrowded living conditions. The psychological toll correlates with rising divorce rates—among the highest in the world per capita—and the fraying of the social fabric. A recent 2025 study by UNFPA and MNU found that 65% of young adults cited housing insecurity as a primary reason for delaying or forgoing parenthood. We are effectively eating our future to pay for today's rent. Current policy responses often tinker at the edges of this catastrophe. We see lotteries for flats or land that don’t deliver on time and leaving the majority disappointed and suspicious of the allocation process. While the Tenancy Act bill and similar legislative protections are vital for defining rights and balancing the landlord-tenant power dynamic, they cannot manufacture the actual physical and material presence of housing units. The missing variable—the only variable that matters—is mass volume.

Mass construction and the price inflection point

The core proposal is a decisive shift toward mass production of high-density public housing, prioritized over almost all other capital expenditure. The argument for prioritization is simple: housing is the prerequisite for all other development. In waiting for the long-term completion of distant reclamations, we risk losing another generation to overcrowding in the interim. The priority must be to densify and build upwards on the land we have now—particularly all phases of Hulhumalé—as much as possible and as quickly as is possible to do so while maintaining high quality standards and meeting regulations, while the new reclamations take their time to be fully built out and come online.

The goal is to reach a specific economic inflection point. Currently, rental prices are high enough that living alone or as a nuclear family is financially impossible for most young people. They are forced to live with parents or in large shared arrangements well into their 30s. This suppresses household formation, meaning that the number of actual households is far smaller than the number of potential households, which means that the number of households where members are unhappy with their state of living is high. If we increase supply sufficiently, prices would eventually drop to a level where a single income or a young couple’s combined income can support a private apartment. At that point, latent demand becomes active; people move out, new households form, and the social maturity of the population is unlocked as the number of real households matches the number of potential households. This is the target: a rental market where a nurse or a civil servant can afford a one-bedroom apartment without spending most of their income.

The way we allocate the national budget already tells us what we treat as optional and what we treat as essential. In the 2026 budget, all spending classified as “housing and community amenities” – which also includes items such as construction and maintenance of council offices and cemeteries – is around MVR 1.6 billion out of a total expenditure of roughly MVR 49.2 billion. Recreation, culture and religion together have an allocation of around MVR 1.5 billion, with more than MVR 500 million just for recreational and sporting services. Within the Ministry of Housing, Construction and Infrastructure’s budget line, spending classified under “constructing residential buildings” is about MVR 1.1 billion. At the same time, a large share of the capital politically framed as “solving housing” is tied up in long-horizon land reclamation such as the Rasmale’ project. Those projects will not produce liveable neighbourhoods for many years, and may not even be completed if political or fiscal conditions change. The result is a pattern where the function that most directly answers the question “do people have a decent home this decade” is still treated as a minor line item. This is ultimately choice, not an iron law of public finance. For a period of ten years, we can make a different choice. We can decide that new units, secure tenancies and liveable neighbourhoods come first, and that large new reclamation schemes or prestige facilities only proceed once a minimum housing programme is fully funded. That does not mean sports, culture or symbolic projects become unimportant. It means that we recognise housing as the base on which all those other goods rest, and we sequence our investments accordingly.

This requires a construction drive of unprecedented scale. Land in the Greater Malé Region is the most valuable resource the state controls. It should be utilized for maximum public benefit. This means prioritizing high-rise, high-density residential developments over low-density commercial or industrial uses that could be located elsewhere. This will likely require some expropriation of dormant land. There are parcels of land in Hulhumalé and even Malé allocated to private parties or SOEs that have sat undeveloped for years. The state could rigorously enforce development clauses. If land sits dormant beyond a statutory period, it could be expropriated or taxed into development to free up space for this national imperative. Infill development is another aspect, where underutilized plots can be designated it for housing. Every plot that can hold a sustainably hold high-density and high-rise quality apartment complexes must hold one. The goal is to use density well: compact, multi-storey neighbourhoods with reliable lifts, good management and shared services, rather than low-yield sprawl or distant sandbanks that absorb huge capital but leave people far from jobs, schools and care.

Modern urban planning policy consensus recognizes the value of dense housing compared to sprawl – it can keep key amenities with a shorter walk to people; serve more people with public transport to improve mobility within cities; and provide a sufficient market within walking distance to support a thriving mix of businesses, cafes and restaurants, and community spaces. These housing neighbourhoods would need integrated or nearby amenities. Sufficient schools, clinics, green space, and other needs should be met within a short walk from homes. Shops, cafes, and community spaces including third spaces, coworking spaces, and event spaces, can be integrated within buildings. As we will discuss later in the need for all these built apartment complexes to be mixed-income housing with a variety of class backgrounds and income levels in their inhabitants, they should be at a standard where residents can at least easily access key amenities such as a swimming pool, gym, playground, or community deck. In a high-density environment, they are spaces necessary for social cohesion and mental health. People need space outside their apartment to breathe.

This density would be supported by high-frequency public transport that connect these residential zones to job centres, reducing the need for private vehicle ownership and further lowering the cost of living. To keep the streets in these neighbourhoods clear and traffic uncongested, these buildings can include multi-level parking sufficient with enough capacity for not just residents' vehicles but even those nearby – this allows each building to also double as excess parking to absorb existing vehicles from the streets. This clears the streets for pedestrians and reclaims the public realm.

Learning from the Singapore Model

The gold standard for this approach is the Housing & Development Board (HDB) of Singapore. Facing a similar crisis of land scarcity, slums, and ethnic tension in the 1960s, Singapore did not leave housing to the private market. They treated it as a national utility, critical for national survival. The state built high-quality, high-density housing and sold 99-year leasehold interests to citizens, creating a nation of homeowners. By 1990, 87% of the population lived in HDB flats. Official histories of the HDB report that the agency has built more than 800 000 flats, housing about 85% of Singapore’s population[^124]. The proportion of Singapore’s residents living in HDB flats rose from 9% in 1960 to 35 % in 1970, 67% by 1980, and over 80% since 1985[^125]. These statistics validate the brief’s proposal to build mass public housing.

Three key lessons from the HDB model are directly applicable to the Maldives:

- **Quality as a minimum standard:** The HDB refused to build "poor housing for poor people." HDB estates are designed to be desirable for the middle class, with amenities and maintenance standards that rival private developments. They ensured that public housing was not a transiting point for the destitute but a lifelong home for the majority. This prevented the ghettoization that plagued public housing projects in the West.

- **Asset enhancement:** Singapore views public housing as a way to transfer wealth to citizens. By buying a leasehold flat, citizens gain an appreciable asset. The government actively maintains and upgrades older estates (through the Asset Enhancement Scheme) to ensure their value does not decay, protecting the savings of the homeowners.

- **Social engineering via housing:** Singapore utilized housing policy to forge a national identity. They implemented the Ethnic Integration Policy, which set quotas for different ethnic groups in every block to prevent the formation of racial enclaves. This forced integration fostered social cohesion. In the Maldives, we face a different divide—class and regional origin—but the principle of using housing allocation to foster integration is just as vital.

Mixed-income development and social integration

Adapting this to the Maldives involves a rejection of the "social housing" label as a separate category of building. Across the world, segregating low-income families into specific blocks such as housing projects has been a disaster for social cohesion. It concentrates poverty, stigmatizes residents, and creates zones of neglect. Poorer and marginalized residents who are vulnerable within society also have the least political voice, which means that needed upkeep and developments or services for their neighbourhoods are likeliest to be neglected over time and abandoned. Because the residents lack political capital and economic power, maintenance budgets are cut, security fails, and the buildings slowly turn into slums. Residents of such blocks can also face discrimination in job applications and social settings purely based on how their address would immediately provide information about their financial or social precarity. Instead, housing would be built en masse in a model of mixed-income public housing. A single building complex would not be designated "social housing" or "market housing”. It would simply be housing. Inside, it would contain a diverse ecosystem of units:

- **Market Units (approx. 60%):** The majority of units would be rented or sold at rates that generate a small return above cost for the government. These are for the middle class, the civil servants, and the young professionals who are currently being gouged in the private market. They get a high-quality home at a fair price sufficient to recoup the costs of development, fund the maintenance and upkeep of the neighbourhood, and provide a small profit to cross-subsidize the social housing for those in need. The revenue from these units is the financial engine of the system.

- **Social Units (approx. 30%):** Interspersed on the same floors—with no distinguishing characteristics or separation—would be units allocated to those with the highest social need: single parents, persons with disabilities, and those in abject poverty. These tenants would pay subsidized rents or nothing at all, depending on their need as seen through the transparent scoring system.

- **Premium/Luxury Units (approx. 10%):** The top floors could be dedicated to penthouses or larger premium units sold at market-plus rates to the wealthy.

This mix can achieve a financially sustainable model to build housing, and a socially and politically suitable model for provision of social housing. The profits from the Premium and Market units cross-subsidize the Social units. This frees the housing system from total dependence on the state budget, allowing it to scale faster than tax revenue alone would permit. More importantly, it ensures social integration[^126]. The importance of breaking social divisions by integration of disparate communities through the distribution of housing was a core success of Singapore’s HDB model. The presence of middle-income or wealthy individuals with sufficient political capital and voice in an area also creates the needed pressure to ensure their continued upkeep, maintenance, and safety. When a Minister or a successful business owner lives in the same building as a recipient of single-parent support, the political pressure to maintain the elevators, keep the lobby clean, and ensure security remains high. Without relying on the benevolence of individuals and rather just aligning their own self-interest with those of the people, this "elite pressure" can be used to ensure the quality of life for the vulnerable residents. Everyone enters through the same lobby; everyone shares the same swimming pool. This destigmatizes social assistance. It turns housing from a marker of class division into a shared civic experience.

The allocation mechanism: The Universal Housing Portal

The massive physical construction must be matched by an allocation system that is transparent, fair, and immune to political tampering. The current system—fragmented applications for different schemes, opaque criteria, and released lists—is a breeding ground for distrust. Rather, a single universal housing portal which tracks all of the government’s built housing and, a single digital front door for all government housing.

This system can function similarly to effective merit-based immigration systems which work on a points and queues approach, such as Canada’s Express Entry immigration system[^127]. In the Canadian model, candidates enter a pool and are ranked by a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. The government opens up a selected number of a few hundred permanent residency slots every few months, conducts draws, and invites the highest-ranking candidates to apply for permanent residence[^128]. For example, if 500 permanent residency plots become available, the highest scoring 500 are given the invite, with the tie-breaker for equal scores being in order of when they applied. So for example, if there were 400 people who had CRS scores above 470 and 600 people who were at exactly 470, then those 500 slots would go to those 400 people with higher scores first and then go by queue position for the 100 earliest applicants out of those remaining 600. By the next round, the point distribution might have 300 people with varying very high scores over 470, and the remaining 500 out of those previous 600 people who were exactly 470, as well as any new applicants who scored 470 too and now join the back of the queue for the tiebreak. Then, the next 500 slots will go to those 300 higher scores and the remaining 200 earliest applicants who were tied at 470 points (who would have been 101st to 300th in the prior round). The pool is dynamic; candidates can update their profiles, and if their score improves, their rank rises[^129].

A housing portal could adapt this logic:

**1. One Profile:** A citizen creates one permanent profile on the portal, linked to their digital identity (eFaas). They enter their data once: income, marital status, number of children, current living situation, disabilities, etc. They do not apply for specific "schemes." They simply apply for housing.

**2. Auto-Enrolment and Dynamic Qualification:** The system automatically determines which pools the applicant qualifies for based on their data. Everyone qualifies for the general scheme for the opportunity to buy or lease a public housing unit from the government in the market model where the government charges an amount that is just above cost as earlier discussed, enough to pay for the development while supporting continued maintenance and provision of amenities and services, and cross-subsidize part of the social housing – which would still be a significantly lower price than current market prices. There are also social housing schemes which people can qualify for, which lets them enter the queue for those specific units, where those in need are both likelier to move up these more selective queues quickly. If you were, for example, a single mother earning \<10,000 MVR, you are automatically enlisted in the "General" pool AND the social housing pool for any schemes to which you qualify. If your circumstances change—for example, you get divorced or have another child—you would just update your profile, after which the system instantly recalculates your score and auto-enrols you in the relevant new pools (e.g. moving you into the social housing category). You would not need to submit a new application to register your need.

**3. Transparent Scoring Rubric** Every applicant receives a score based on a public, objective rubric. Points are awarded for verifiable needs. For example:

- **Overcrowding:** High points for low square-footage-per-person in current accommodation.

- **Income to Rent Ratio:** Points for high financial stress.

- **Vulnerability:** Points for disabilities, single-parent status, or elderly dependents.

**4. The Dynamic Queue and "The Draw"** Instead of a static list, there is a live, dynamic queue. An applicant can see their score (e.g. 75/100) and their rank (e.g. \#450 in the General pool, \#30 in the Single Parent Scheme pool). When a new building is completed, the government announces allocation for the full number of units that come online. For example, with an apartment building including 200 units that fall within the government portal system, it might be "We have 150 general units and 50 Single Parent Scheme units". The system then invites the top 150 scorers in the general pool and the top 50 in the social housing pool. In this case, the one who was \#30 in the Single Parent Scheme pool gets offered a unit under that scheme, and upon acceptance is removed from the queue entirely. Those who were 151st and below in the General pool and 31st or below in the Single Parent Scheme pool now rise to the top of the queue, and so on. Where someone qualifies for multiple schemes, they get to choose and the vacated slot from the remaining schemes goes to whoever was next in queue.

**5. Application date as tiebreaker:** In the inevitable event of ties in scoring (e.g. 50 people all have a score of 75), the tie-breaker is strictly the *time of application*. This rewards patience. If you applied three years ago, you are ahead of someone with the same need score who applied today. This eliminates discretion and corruption.

**6. Verification at the gate:** To streamline the system, this could remove the burden of verifying documents upfront. Applicants self-declare their data to enter the pool. Verification occurs only at the "Invitation to Apply" stage. When a citizen is selected in a draw, they must then produce the certified documents (marriage certificates, bank statements) to prove their score. If the verification fails (e.g. they claimed a disability they do not have), they are removed from the pool and barred for a period. This reduces the administrative burden of verifying thousands of hopeless applications while maintaining rigorous integrity for the winners.

Under this system, a citizen knows exactly where they stand, why they have that score, and roughly when they might expect a unit.

Political economy and the banking compromise

From a practical perspective, any major policy initiatives that would reduce market rents across the board do have a political economy aspect through current landlords. A massive increase in housing supply will inevitably lower rental yields for existing landlords. In the Maldivian context, landlords will include many families who have taken massive construction loans to build their homes, often at high interest rates (10-12%) with the projection of recouping these costs through renting out part of those homes. There is no tenable way to continue the status quo without much lower rents and mass housing, but there is both political and financial system risk. Homeowners who rely on high rents to pay their monthly loan instalments (which can be 30,000-50,000 MVR) will go underwater. This could threaten the stability of the banking sector, which is heavily exposed to the property market. Beyond that, the political economy aspect does mean that even for governments that want to ultimately solve the housing affordability issue, there is a strong pressure – both from wealthy constituents and donors, but also from how a lot of politicians themselves are likely to be landowners who do make income from rents – for dawdling and half-measures. To try to remove this expected resistance, some kind of compromise policy approach might allow for these massive reforms, such as a restructuring of the housing debt market.

As rental yields fall due to increased supply, banks would agree to reduce the interest rates on existing residential construction loans. Banks face a choice between receiving lower interest payments or facing a wave of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) as landlords default. Rational banking prefers a performing loan at a lower rate (e.g. 6%) than a defaulted loan at 11%. This reduction lowers the monthly repayment burden on landlords. A landlord who used to need 30,000 MVR in rent to pay the bank might now only need 18,000 MVR. They can afford to lower the rent to compete with the new public housing. This aligns the incentives: the landlord class accepts lower rents because their costs have also lowered. The banks avoid a crash. And the general population gets access to affordable housing. It smooths the transition from a scarcity economy to an abundance economy.

In summary

Solving the housing crisis is the master key to unlocking the Maldives' social and economic potential. It is not enough to manage the scarcity; we must end it. By treating housing as a physical allocation problem rather than a financial one, we focus on the only metric that matters: the number of doors available. Through mass construction of mixed-income, high-density developments, allocated through a transparent digital system like Canada's Express Entry, we can break the scarcity trap. This will not only lower the cost of living but also reshape the demographic trajectory of the nation, allowing a generation of Maldivians to finally live with the dignity, independence, and stability they have been denied.
